<a name="Introduction"></a>
<p><font size="+3"><strong>1  Introduction</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>GoldWave<sup></sup> is a comprehensive digital audio editor that plays, records,
edits, and converts audio on your computer.  This section lists some of the
features of GoldWave and outlines the notation and organization of the
manual.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<p><hr>

<a name="Features"></a>
<font size="+1"><strong>Features</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>GoldWave includes a full set of features that rival even the most expensive
audio processors:

<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> An intuitive and customizable user interface makes
editing easy.</li>
  <li> An independent <strong>Device Controls</strong> window provides direct access to
audio devices.  It contains controls for playback, rewind &amp; fast
forward, recording, volume, and speed.  LED meters and
real-time graphs display the sound during playback and
recording.</li>
  <li> A multiple document interface (MDI) allows many files to be
opened at one time, simplifying file-to-file editing.</li>
  <li> Huge files can be edited using <strong>hard disk</strong> storage.  Small files can
be edited quickly using <strong>RAM</strong> storage.</li>
  <li> Sounds are displayed graphically as a waveform and the level of
detail can be changed by zooming in or out. The waveform can be
reshaped directly with the mouse when zoomed in.</li>
  <li> Many audio effects, such as <strong>Reverse</strong>, <strong>Echo</strong>, <strong>Pan</strong>, <strong>Flange</strong>,
<strong>Dynamics</strong>, and <strong>Time warp</strong>, enhance, distort, or
alter sounds in various ways.</li>
  <li> Sophisticated filters such as the <strong>Noise reduction</strong>
   and <strong>Pop/Click</strong> filters help restore audio.
  <li> The <strong>Batch conversion</strong> command converts a group of
sound files to a different format and type.  It can convert stereo to mono,
8 to 16 bits, or any combination of attributes supported
by a file type.  With an MPEG codec installed, you can compress audio
to a fraction of its original size while still keeping excellent
quality in MP3 format.</li>
  <li> The <strong>CD Audio Extraction</strong> tool copies audio from a CD
to a file on your system.  Audio can be extracted directly to MP3 format to
minimize storage space.
  <li> An <strong>Expression Evaluator</strong> allows you to generate everything from
simple tones to complex filters.  Expressions for telephone dial
tones, waves, and effects are included.</li>
</ul>

<p><hr>

<a name="How to Use This Manual"></a>
<font size="+2"><strong>How to Use This Manual</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Familiarity with the Windows interface, such as property dialogs, tool
bars, etc., is recommended before reading this manual.

<br><br>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with digital audio, <strong>Appendix A</strong> briefly
introduces some of the fundamentals of computer audio.  It also provides
some solutions to common recording problems.  <strong>Appendix D</strong> contains
troubleshooting information and answers to common questions.

<br><br>
<p><strong>Section 2: Getting Started</strong>, covers system requirements and installation.
<strong>Section 3: Using GoldWave</strong> explains the interface and menu structure in
detail.  Topics are covered in the order that they appear in GoldWave's
menu.  <strong>Section 4: General Information</strong>, provides support, copyright, and
warranty information.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<p><hr>

<a name="Notation"></a>
<font size="+2"><strong>Notation</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p><strong>Bold</strong> text and a vertical bar are used to denote menu commands.
<strong>File&nbsp;|&nbsp;New</strong>, for example,  means to select the <strong>New</strong> command from the <strong>File</strong>
menu.  This notation is used to refer to other sections within this manual as
well.  In the above example, you can find information by looking for <strong>New</strong>
under the <strong>File Menu Commands</strong> section.  If the first word is <strong>Start</strong>, select
the command from the Windows task bar menu structure.

<br><br>
<p><hr>

<a name="System Requirements"></a>
<font size="+1"><strong>System Requirements</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The minimum system requirements for GoldWave are:

<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Pentium based PC or compatible</li>
  <li> Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> Windows<sup>&#174;</sup> 95 or Windows<sup>&#174;</sup> NT 4.0 or higher</li>
  <li> 32 Megabytes of RAM (64 MB recommended)</li>
  <li> 2 Megabytes of hard disk space</li>
  <li> Mouse</li>
  <li> Sound card with a Windows driver</li>

<br><br></ul>

<p>If you need to edit large files, you will need a large amount of  hard drive
space.  One minute of CD-quality sound requires 10 megabytes of storage.
GoldWave may require 20 to 40 megabytes per minute when editing an
existing file and the <strong>Undo</strong> feature is enabled.

<p> For editing audio in movie files and editing <strong>mp3</strong> files,
you must have the new DirectX Media extensions installed.  You can install
the new Media Player available from Microsoft's website to get these
extensions.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>

<a name="Interface Overview"></a>
<font size="+2"><strong>Interface Overview</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>GoldWave is composed of three windows: the Main window, the Device
Controls window, and Sound windows.  The Main window contains the
main menu, two rows of tool bar buttons, and status bars (see Figure 1).  It
groups together and manages all the Sound windows.

<br><br>
<p><center><img src="figure01.png" width="664" height="460" align="center" alt="Main Window"><br>
Figure 1: Main Window</center>

<p>The tool bar buttons provide quick access to many of the frequently used
commands.  The upper bar holds File, Edit, and View commands, while the
lower bar contains Effects and Tools commands.  The function of each
button is displayed in the lower status bar when the mouse pointer is
positioned directly over it.  Tool bars can be configured using the
<strong>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Tool bar</strong> command.

<br><br>
<p>The status bars show attributes of the Sound window, including the
sampling rate, length, selected region, channels, and general file format
information.  By clicking the mouse pointer over any status item that shows
time (shown as * in Figure 2), the unit or format for that status item can be
changed.  If you click the mouse pointer over the length item, for example,
you will be presented with a menu showing length in terms of storage size,
time, and samples.

<br><br>
<p><center><img src="figure02.png" width="646" height="42" align="center" alt="Status Bar Contents"><br>
Figure 2: Status Bar Contents</center>

<p>Sound windows are created when you open a file.  These windows contain
a waveform graph of the sound with a time axis near the bottom.  For stereo
sounds, two separate graphs are shown.  The top green graph is the left
channel and the bottom red graph is the right channel.  The selected part of
the sound is highlighted with a blue background.

<br><br>
<p>Near the bottom of the Sound window, a small "Overview" bar representing
the entire sound shows you what part of the sound is selected (highlighted
green and/or red), what part is displayed in the above graph (black
background), and what part is not visible in the above graph (dark grey
background).  Initially, the entire sound is selected.

<br><br>
<p>You can change the selection by using the left and right mouse buttons.
You can configure the window size and axes format of Sound windows
using the <strong>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Window</strong> command.  The <strong>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Colours</strong> command
sets the colour scheme.

<br><br>
<p>The Device Controls window interacts directly with your sound card.  It
contains buttons to play and record sounds as well as controls for volume,
balance, and playback speed (provided your audio device supports these
features).  LED meters and real-time graphs display audio data
whenever a sound is played or recorded.  Detailed information about the
graphical displays and controls is presented in the next section.

<br><br>

<a name="Device Controls Overview"></a>
<strong><font size="+2">Device Controls Overview</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>The Device Controls window (see Figure 3) is an easy-to-use interface to
your audio hardware and drivers.  On the bottom half of this window are
graphs in which sound is displayed during playback and recording.  On
the top left section of the window is a standard set of audio controls,
including play, stop, record, rewind, pause, and fast forward.  LED meters
are located below these controls.  In the top right section of the window are
controls to set the device's output volume, balance, and playback speed.

<br><br>
<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
The Device Controls window can be resized to change
the size of the graphs or to hide them.

<td valign="top">Plays region between start and finish
markers.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Unselected</td>
<td valign="top">Plays regions outside the start and finish
markers.  This lets you quickly test how a
cut or delete will sound without actually
changing the sound.  When possible,
playback is confined to the region shown in
the Sound window view so that the entire
sound does not have to be played.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">View</td>
<td valign="top">Plays all of the sound currently shown in the
Sound window view.  This is useful if you
zoomed in on part of the sound.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Finish</td>
<td valign="top">Plays three seconds just before the finish
marker, so you can determine if that marker
is in the right place without listening to the
entire selection.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Intro/loop/end</td>
<td valign="top">This is a special playback feature that plays
the sound in three sections.  The beginning
of the sound, outside the selection, is played
first.  Then the selection is played and
looped. Finally the end of the sound, outside
the selection, is played.  This is useful for
musical accompaniment or looped
instrument samples.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Loop</td>
<td valign="top">If checked, it specifies the number of times
playback should be repeated.  A value of 1
loops playback once, so the selection is
played twice.  A zero value loops forever.</td></tr></table>

<p>	<strong>Fast/Rewind speed</strong>

<p>	The playback speed of the fast forward and rewind buttons is
controlled by these values.  A value of 1.00 is normal speed.
Entering a value of 3.00 for Rewind speed, for example, means the
rewind button will play the sound backwards three times faster than
normal.  By entering small numbers (such as 0.1) the rewind and
fast forward buttons will play very slowly.  This is useful for
finding pops or clicks, since the graphs will move slowly
through the data.

<a name="Record Properties"></a>
<p>	<strong><font size="+1">Record Properties</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>	The Record Properties page includes features to monitor the
recording sources, start recording automatically when a sound is
detected, or delay recording for a certain length of time.  The basic
options are as follows:

<br><br>
<center>
<table border cellpadding=5 width="75%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%"><strong>Option</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="70%"><strong>Purpose</strong></td></tr>

<td valign="top">Monitor</td>
<td valign="top">Connects the recording source to the
graphs and LED meters so you can
adjust volume levels before recording.  See
<strong>Recording Sounds</strong> for information about
selecting a different recording source and
setting volumes.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Loop</td>
<td valign="top">Restarts recording when the end is reached
and continues to record over and over until
the stop button is pressed.  This is useful if
you are trying to capture a sound but do not
know when it might occur.  By loop
recording a 1 minute sound, you will always
have the last minute of audio stored for
recall.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Ctrl key safety</td>
<td valign="top">Prevents you from accidentally recording
over a sound.  To record, you must hold
down the Ctrl key, otherwise a safety
message appears.</td></tr>

undo recording after.  If you record
large files, you should not check this setting.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Mix with
selection</td>
<td valign="top">Mixes the newly recorded sound with the
existing sound.  This lets you layer
recordings.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Disable write
cache</td>
<td valign="top">Immediately writes the newly recorded
sound directly to the hard drive.  Normally,
Windows will temporarily save the sound in
memory (cache) before writing it to the hard
drive.  However, when recording large files,
the memory quickly becomes full and
Windows is forced to write a large amount
of data.  This can cause skipping and gaps in
the recording.  In some cases, disabling
write cache can solve this problem.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Unbounded</td>
<td valign="top"> Continues recording until all storage is exhausted or until you
press the record stop button.  The file size is increased automatically
to hold the new audio, which can save time when recording for a long
period of time.  You <em>must</em> enable
<a href="#Direct-to-Disk">Hard disk</a> storage under
<a href="#File">Options | File</a>
when using this option.  If you are using RAM storage, this
option is ignored.
</td></tr>

</center>
<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Delayed recording</strong>

<p>	The Timer delays recording until the specified time and day of
the week.  Use this feature to automatically record something at
a later time.  The time is given in 24 hour time.  A time of 06:00:00 is
6:00 AM and a time of 18:00:00 is 6:00 PM.  00:30:00 is 12:30 AM or
30 minutes past midnight.  If entering the time directly, remember
to include the seconds.  Entering 18:00 means 00:18:00. 
You must press the record button to activate the timer.

<br><br>
<p>Level activated
recording is useful for automatically synchronizing recording to a
sound source or efficiently capturing airport or police radio where
there may be a lot of silence that does not need to be recorded.
It automatically starts recording when the sound source is above a given level
and pauses recording when the sound is below the level.
The Threshold specifies
how loud a sound should be before recording
begins.  A value less than 0.2 is typical.  The
Duration specifies how long to record after the
sound becomes quiet again.  Using a value of 3 allows recording to
continue for three seconds after the sound goes below the specified
threshold.  To minimize silence, use a value of 1 second or
less, but not zero.  A zero value causes recording to continue without
stopping once the level first activates.  The
Time stamp cues option provides a way of marking the date,
time, and position of each activation.  Cue points with the current
date and time are created and can be view under the
<a href="#Cue points">Cue points</a> tool.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Volume Properties"></a>
<p>	<strong><font size="+1">Volume Properties</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>The Volume Properties page lets you adjust
recording volumes and select or unselect recording sources.


<p>A volume fader and checkbox is shown for each source.  To select a
source, check the appropriate checkbox.  If your sound card has
a master control, make sure that the <strong>Mute all</strong> option
is turned off and that the master volume is not zero.


<p>You can use the Monitor
option under the <a href="#Record Properties">Record Properties</a>
tab to activate the LED meters and real-time graphs without recording.
By moving the Properties window, you can see the levels as you
adjust the volume faders.

<p>Note that volumes are changed regardless of whether you choose
OK or Cancel.  Using Cancel will prevent the left
and right graphs from being set the same when you close the Properties
window.

<td valign="top">X-Y mode</td>
<td valign="top">The sound is plotted with the left channel against the right channel to
generate a Lissajous pattern.  This is often used to see the phase difference
between two equal frequency signals.  If the left and right channels
are in phase, the pattern is a diagonal line running from
the lower left to the upper right.  If the channels are 90 degrees
out of phase, the pattern is a circle.  For general stereo
sounds, it looks like a crazy scribble.  The larger the scribble,
the larger the difference between the channels.  Monaural sounds
always show a diagonal line since the left and right data
are the same.</td></tr>

<p>	The axes of these graphs will be numerically labelled if you check
the Show axis box.  Note that you may have to resize the Device
Controls window to make more room.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Window function</strong>

<p>	When calculating any frequency related graphs, a window function
must be used to smooth out analysis.  The Kaiser 7 or Hamming
windows are usually the best, but you can try the other windows
just to compare the results.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Refresh</strong>

<p>	Frames/s sets the number of times per second that
graphs and LED meters are updated.  A value of 30 or less
gives good results, but you may want to use 60 to get an extra
detailed spectrogram.  The LED hold time is the amount of time, in
milliseconds, that the peak LED meter level is retained.
Note that the top red overload LED remains lit until
the sound is stopped.  Fade time is the amount of time,
in milliseconds, that it takes for the LED meters and the colour
and fire spectrum graphs to drop from maximum to zero.

<br><br>

<a name="Device Properties"></a>
<p>	<strong><font size="+1">Device Properties</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>	The Device Properties page lists playback and recording devices
and shows the capabilities of the selected device.  Normally, you do
not need to change these settings unless you have more than one
sound card or you encounter a problem.

<br><br>
<p>	Some sound card drivers do not report the current playback/record
position correctly.  In such cases, you will notice that the time in the
status bar is incorrect and the white "current position" line in the
Sound window is moving too fast or too slow.  If this happens,
select a different Positioning setting.

<br><br>
<p>	If you notice memory errors or gaps during playback or recording,
change the Buffer size settings.  The Buffer size determines the
amount of audio, in seconds, that is transferred from the device
driver to GoldWave.  Values of 1 second or less give the best
results.

The Joystick control option allows you to control playback and recording
using a standard joystick.  The first available and attached joystick
is used.  The directions control playback with left
for rewind, right for fast forward, down for pause, and up to unpause.
The first button (button 1 or A) starts and stops playback.  The second
button (button 2 or B) starts and stops recording.

<a name="Selecting Part of a Sound"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Selecting Part of a Sound</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Almost all commands in GoldWave operate on the currently selected part
of a sound.  The selected part, or <em>selection</em>, is the highlighted part of the
sound between two vertical markers (see Figure 1).  The vertical markers are
cyan lines located to the left side (<em>start</em> marker) and right side (<em>finish</em>
marker) of the view.

<br><br>
<p>
Note that GoldWave does not use the standard "click-and-drag"
method to make a selection because it does not allow accurate
positioning of both markers.  Instead, it uses an innovative method
that lets you independently set the start and finish markers to the
nearest sample (when zoomed in at a 1:1 level or better).  The
mouse pointer appears as
<img src="figure05.png" width="22" height="24" align="bottom" alt="Marker Cursor">
when the markers can be moved.

<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> To move the <em>start</em> marker, click the <em>left</em> mouse button on the graph
at the point where you want to move it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> To move the <em>finish</em> marker, click the <em>right</em> mouse button on the
graph at the point where you want to move it.</li>

<br><br></ul>

<p>Additional notes and techniques:

<ul>
  <li> You cannot place the finish marker before the start marker.  The
same is true for setting the start marker after the finish marker.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> You can set a marker's position by clicking in the Sound window's
Overview box.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> The <strong>Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Marker&nbsp;|&nbsp;Snap to zero-crossing</strong> feature helps to
minimize pops and click by finding a point where the waveform is
close to zero amplitude.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> To find a certain part of the sound, you can play the sound and
mark it as it plays using the <strong>[</strong> and <strong>]</strong> (bracket) keys.  GoldWave
indicates the part being played with a white, vertical line.  You can
use the rewind and fast forward buttons to pinpoint a sound.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> To select a single channel of a stereo sound use the <strong>Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Channel</strong>
command or the <strong>Chan</strong> button.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> In most cases, editing and effects are performed only on the
selection.  Some effects, such as the <strong>Expression evaluator</strong>,
<strong>Resample</strong>, and <strong>Playback rate</strong> alter the entire sound.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> The Windows clipboard is used for most of the editing commands. 
If the selection is too large to copy into the clipboard, GoldWave
will automatically create a temporary file to simulate the clipboard. 
If you notice any freezes during editing, use the <strong>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File</strong>
command to always use the GoldWave clipboard.</li>

<br><br>
<p>You can directly edit the waveform with the mouse to remove pops and
clicks or draw new sound waves.  To do this, you must first zoom in so that
individual samples are visible (see <strong>View&nbsp;|&nbsp;Zoom 5:1</strong> or <strong>View&nbsp;|&nbsp;Zoom 10:1</strong>). 
If the sound was flash opened, you will need to use the <strong>Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Deflash</strong>
command to prepare the sound for editing.

<ol>
  <li> Choose <strong>Deflash</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, if enabled.
  <li> Zoom in 2:1 or closer.</li>
  <li> Place the mouse arrow directly over the waveform.  The
arrow will change into a thin horizontal line with two small
arrows pointing to it.

<p><font size="+1"><strong>Mixing and Cross-Fading</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The <strong>Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Mix</strong> command mixes one sound with another so they both play
at the same time.  If you wanted to add vocals to music, for example, you
would perform the following steps:

<ol>
  <li> Open the sound containing the vocals.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Copy</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu.</li>
  <li> Open the sound containing the music.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Mix</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu.</li>
  <li> Enter a volume to mix the vocals (100 = full volume).</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
When mixing more than a couple of sounds, you should reduce the
mixing volume and the destination volume to prevent clipping
distortion.  The volume of the destination sound can be reduced
before mixing by using the <strong>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume&nbsp;|&nbsp;Change</strong> command.

<br><br>
<p>To cross-fade two sounds, such as having one song fade out while another
is fading in, follow these steps:

<ol>
  <li> Open the first song.</li>
  <li> Move the start marker to select the last 3 seconds of the song.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Fade out</strong> from the <strong>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume</strong> sub menu and use a
<strong>100</strong>% fade.</li>
  <li> Open the second song.</li>
  <li> Move the finish marker to select the first 3 seconds of the song.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Fade in</strong> from the <strong>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume</strong> sub menu and use an
initial volume of <strong>0</strong>%.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Select all</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu.</li>

<br><br>
<p>GoldWave supports both direct-to-disk editing and RAM (physical
computer memory) editing, along with a time saving flash feature.  These
features are configured using the <strong>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File</strong> command.  If you have 32
megabytes of RAM or more and often edit files less than 10 megabytes in
size, the RAM storage option gives the best performance.

Storage Overview</center>

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Direct-to-Disk"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Direct-to-Disk</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>In direct-to-disk editing, the entire sound is stored in a temporary file where
it can be modified.  This allows you to edit very large files (up to about 1
billion bytes in size) provided the required disk space is available.  Only a
small amount of RAM is required for each opened sound.  The drawback
is that editing and effects processing take more time since audio data must
be transferred to and from the disk.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="RAM"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>RAM</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>In RAM editing, the entire sound is stored in memory.  This allows you to
edit and process files very quickly.  It saves time and reduces the burden on
your hard disk.  The drawback is that the size of the files must be small
enough to fit in the available RAM (not including virtual memory).

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Flash"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Flash</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The flash feature opens large files instantly.  The entire file is not copied to
temporary storage and only a few seconds of the sound is initially graphed. 
This can save a great deal of time if you only want to play a file and not
modify it.  A flashed file can be deflashed at any time by using the
<strong>Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Deflash</strong> command.  In most cases, GoldWave automatically deflashes
the file for you.

<br><br>
<p>A flashed file requires no extra disk space and only a small amount of
RAM, which means that several large files can be opened at once, regardless
of how much free space is available on the disk.  The drawback is that you
need a fast system when a file has to be decompressed for playback.

<br><br>
<p>Sound files come in a variety of forms.  Usually, the form or <em>type</em> of sound
can be determined from its filename extension, such as <strong>.wav</strong> or <strong>.mp3</strong>.
GoldWave supports all the sound types listed in Table 1.  Each file type can
have several sub-formats or <em>attributes</em>.  The <strong>.wav</strong> type for example, can hold
audio encoded or compressed in dozens of different ways, including PCM,
ADPCM, companded, or MPEG1 Layer 3.

<br><br>
<p>Normally, GoldWave detects and automatically opens all the supported file
types.  However, there are several cases where GoldWave may not be able
to open a file:

<ol>
  <li> The file type is not supported by GoldWave.</li>
  <li> The file does not contain any header information and there is no
extension association (see <strong>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File types</strong>).</li>
  <li> The file contains compressed or encoded audio that GoldWave
cannot decompress or decode.</li>
  <li> The codec to decompress the file is not installed on your system.
  <li> The file type is recognized, but the file structure is invalid or
corrupt.  Unfortunately, there are many programs which create
badly structured <strong>.wav</strong> files.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

<p>If any of these conditions occur, GoldWave presents the <strong>File Format</strong> dialog
(Figure 7) so that you can specify the format and attributes manually. If you
have a file that contains audio copied directly from a CD, for example, you
would choose the <strong>PCM</strong> format and <strong>16-bit, stereo, signed</strong> attributes, with
a sampling rate of 44100&nbsp;Hz.  The basic formats are given in Table 2.

<p>If you do not know the format, experiment with trial-and-error.  Start with
an 8 bit or 16 bit PCM format, then try the mu-law or A-law Telephony
formats.  Generally, sounds will be noisy if the format or number of bits is
incorrect, in which case you will have to close and reopen the sound using
a different format.  You can leave the sampling rate unchanged since it
affects only the playback speed and can be changed later using
<strong>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Playback rate</strong>.
<a href="#Appendix: An Introduction to Digital Audio">Appendix A</a>

<p>Use <strong>New</strong> to create a new sound with attributes you specify.  These attributes
are discussed in
<a href="#Appendix: An Introduction to Digital Audio">Appendix A</a>.
Note that GoldWave allows you to create
and edit sounds that may not be playable with your audio hardware.  If you
encounter any "capabilities" error messages, try selecting the Microsoft
Sound Mapper device under <strong>Device Controls</strong>
<a href="#Device Properties">Device Properties</a>.  For Web
and Java applications, you should specify mono, with a sampling rate of
8000&nbsp;Hz.  For CD quality, use stereo, with a sampling rate of 44100&nbsp;Hz, or
simply choose the <strong>CD</strong> button.

<p>The <strong>Open</strong> command presents a list of files in your sound folder.  The
default sound folder can be set using the <strong>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File</strong> command.  All file
types having a recognized extension are listed.  After you select a file, a
Sound window is opened and details about the sound are displayed in the
status bar.  See the <strong>File Format</strong> section above if GoldWave could not open
the file.

<br><br>
<p>The <strong>Storage Overview</strong> section explains how the sounds are stored for
editing.  Depending on the size of the file, you may want to change the
storage setting under <strong>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File</strong>.

examing the file's "Details" properties in Explorer.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Batch conversion"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Batch conversion</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p> <strong>Batch conversion</strong> converts a set of files from one
format to another.  You can use this feature to compress all your
<strong>.wav</strong> files to <strong>.mp3</strong>
to save disk space or convert from <strong>.mp3</strong> to
<strong>.wav</strong> to prepare for writing to a CD-R disc.

<p> To add files to the conversion list, use the <strong>Add files</strong>
button or drag-and-drop files with Windows Explorer.  You can remove files
by selecting them and choosing the <strong>Remove</strong>
button.  The <strong>Clear</strong> button removes all files from the list.

<p>The <strong>Rate</strong> check box lets you specify a sampling rate for
attributes that do not list one, such as 8 or 16-bit files.  The rate is
<strong>not</strong> used if the attributes already specify a rate.  For some
file types, like VOX files, only certain rates are supported, and
the closest compatible rate will be used.

<p> The destination file types and attributes are the same as given under
the <strong><a href="#Save as">Save as</a></strong> command.  You must select
the file type before selecting attributes since attributes vary
from one type to the next.

<p> The <strong>Destination folder</strong> specifies where all the converted
files will be stored.  If the destination folder is blank, the converted
files are stored in the same folder as the original file.

<p>The <strong>Overwrite existing files</strong> option allows you to replace
the original files with the converted format.  Overwriting only occurs
if the destination folder and file type match the original.

<p>The <strong>Author</strong> and <strong>Copyright</strong> text is
stored in file types that support such information as explained under
the <strong><a href="#Information">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Information</a></strong>
command.

<p>Press the <strong>Begin</strong> button to start converting all the files.
A status window will appear to show the progress of the conversion and
list any errors.

<a name="Save"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Save</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The sound is saved in a file using its original name and type.  If memory or
disk space is low, the file may not be saved successfully.  GoldWave will
inform you if this happens.  If <strong>Save</strong> fails, try deleting some unneeded files
or close other applications.  Make sure that the file is saved successfully
before closing GoldWave, otherwise the sound will be lost.  Note that
audio from video and movie files cannot be saved.  You must save those files
in an "audio only" format.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Save as"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Save as</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p><strong>Save as</strong> saves a sound using a different filename or file type.  To save the
sound using a different name, simply type in the new name in the <strong>File name</strong>
box.  To save the sound using a different type, select the type from the <strong>Save
as type</strong> list box, then select attributes from the <strong>Attributes</strong> list box.  Since
each file type supports different attributes, always select the type before
selecting attributes.  Java and Web sounds, for example, should be saved
using the "Sun (*.au)" type and the "Java/Web" attribute.

<br><br>
<p>You can use <strong>Save as</strong> to compress a sound as
well.  If you have an MPEG1
Layer 3 encoder installed, for example, you can compress a sound so that it
is  over 10 times smaller.  To do this, select the "MPEG Audio (*.mp3)" type and
one of the listed "MPEG" attributes.  Use 128kbps (128 kilobits per second)
or higher for best quality.

<br><br>
<p>If you frequently use a certain file type and attributes, select those settings
then choose the <strong>Set custom</strong> button.  The next time you use <strong>Save as</strong>, you can
choose the <strong>Custom</strong> button to quickly retrieve those settings.

<br><br>
<p><img src="warn.png" width="18" height="19" align="left" alt="Warning">

<a name="Cut"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Cut</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Use <strong>Cut</strong> to remove the selection from the sound and put it in the clipboard.
The contents of the clipboard can then be superimposed or inserted into a
Sound window using <strong>Mix</strong> or <strong>Paste</strong>.  If you just want to remove the selection
and do not need to paste or mix it, you should use the <strong>Delete</strong> command
instead.

<br><br>
<p>Note that if only one channel is selected in a stereo sound, then only that
channel is removed.  Since it is not possible for one channel to be longer
than the other, the end of the cut channel is padded with silence (this is also
true for <strong>Delete</strong>).

<br><br>
<p>To cut:

<ol>
  <li> Move the start and finish markers to the part of the sound you want
to cut.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Cut</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu or click on the <strong>Cut</strong> button.</li>

<p><font size="+1"><strong>Replace</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Use <strong>Replace</strong> to replace the selection with the clipboard.  The selection is
deleted and the clipboard is inserted in its place.  If the clipboard is longer
or shorter than the selection, the length of the file is adjusted as required.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Delete"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Delete</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p><strong>Delete</strong> removes the selection from the sound.  The selection is not copied
to the clipboard.  You should always use <strong>Delete</strong> instead of <strong>Cut</strong> when the
selection is not needed.  The <strong>Delete</strong> command is faster because it does not
copy the selection to the clipboard.

<br><br>
<p>Note that if only one channel is selected in a stereo sound, then only that
channel is removed.  Since it is not possible for one channel to be longer
than the other, the end of the deleted channel is padded with silence (this is
also true for <strong>Cut</strong>).

<br><br>
<p>To delete:

<ol>
  <li> Move the start and finish markers to the part of the sound you want
to delete.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Delete</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu or click on the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<a name="Trim"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Trim</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p><strong>Trim</strong> removes everything <em>outside</em> the selection.  The selection is not
affected.  Use this command to keep a section of sound and discard
everything else.  This command is frequency used after recording.  Note that
if only one channel of a stereo sound is trimmed, the end of that channel
will be padded with silence.  As an alternative, you can use the <strong>Copy to</strong>
command to save the selection to a separate file.

<br><br>
<p>To trim:

<ol>
  <li> Move the start and finish markers to the part of the sound you want
to keep.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Trim</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu or click on the <strong>Trim</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Insert silence"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Insert silence</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>This command inserts some blank space in the sound at the start marker's
position.  You are asked how long (in seconds) the silence should be.  This
command can be used to increase recording time or to insert a delay.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Select view"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Select view</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Use <strong>Select view</strong> to select all of the sound currently shown in the Sound
window's graph.  The start and finish markers are moved to the far left and
far right of the view.  This command appears on the tool bar as the <strong>View</strong>
button.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Select all"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Select all</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Use <strong>Select all</strong> to select the entire sound.  The start and finish markers are
moved to the beginning and end of the sound.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Channel"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Channel</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The <strong>Channel</strong> submenu sets which channel of a stereo sound will be used or
modified by editing or effects.  You can use this feature to copy a single
channel from a stereo sound or apply an effect to only one channel.  The
currently selected channel is shown in the status bar.  When recording or
using effects such as the <strong>Expression evaluator</strong>, <strong>Resample</strong>, <strong>Playback rate</strong>,
<strong>Pan</strong>, and <strong>Exchange channels</strong>, the channel setting has no effect and both the
left and right channels are modified.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Marker"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Marker</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>This submenu lists commands for changing the positions of the start and
finish markers.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Set"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Set</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Sets the start and finish marker to an exact time or sample position.
To specify a time, choose the Time option and enter the time in
hours, minutes, seconds, and thousandths of a second.  For
example,  you could enter 1:04:27.873.  To specify a sample
position, choose  the Sample option and enter the position.

<br><br>
<p>	If you want the length of the selection to be aligned to a CD sector
or 1 kilobyte, select the appropriate option.  When the OK button
is pressed, the finish marker will be adjusted to align the selection
length.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Recall positions"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Recall positions</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Moves the start and finish markers to previously stored positions.  These
positions are set using the <a href="#Store positions">Store positions</a>
command.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Store positions"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Store positions</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Saves the current positions of the start and finish markers.  Use the
<a href="#Recall positions">Recall positions</a> command to move the
markers back to these positions.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Drop start/finish"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Drop start/finish</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	When playing a file, you can drop the start or finish marker at the
current playback position.  You can use the bracket keys, <strong>[</strong> and <strong>]</strong>, to
perform the same command.  Note that the start marker cannot be
dropped after the finish marker.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Snap to zero-crossing"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Snap to zero-crossing</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	When editing, it is necessary that the waveform not change
suddenly from one sample to the next, otherwise a click will occur.
This can happen when deleting the selection.  The amplitude of the
waveform at the start marker may be completely different from the
amplitude at finish marker.  After deleting the selection, these two
different amplitude will be right next to each other, causing a click.

<br><br>
<p>	The <strong>Snap to zero-crossing</strong> feature helps to minimize the problem
by making sure that the markers are always near zero amplitude
samples.  When you drag and release a marker, it is automatically
moved to a position where the amplitude approaches zero.  This
means that when you delete the selection, the amplitudes at both the
start and finish markers will be more closely matched (near zero).

<br><br>
<p>	Since stereo sounds can have very different left and right channels,
it is not always possible to find an ideal zero-crossing position. 
However, you can use the <strong>Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Channel</strong> submenu to limit the
snap feature to a single channel.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Deflash"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Deflash</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p><strong>Deflash</strong> copies a "flash opened" file to temporary storage.  Usually a file is
deflashed automatically.  If you are trying to play a compressed file on a
slow system, convert a file to another type, or directly editing a waveform
with the mouse, use this command to copy the file for processing.  The flash
feature can be configured using the <strong>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File</strong> command.  See the
<strong>Storage Overview</strong> section for more information.

<a name="Effects Menu Commands"></a>
<font size="+2"><strong>Effects Menu Commands</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>With Effects commands, you can dramatically enhance and change sounds. 
These commands are similar to font menu commands in word processors. 
For example, using font commands, you can change the size of the letters. 
In GoldWave, using the <strong>Volume</strong> effect changes the "size" of a sound. 
Changing the colour of a font would be similar to changing the pitch of a
sound.

<br><br>
<p>Note that even though the word "volume" is used throughout this section for
readability, "amplitude" would be more precise.  For an introduction to
some of the terms used in this section, refer to the
<a href="#Editing Overview">Editing Overview</a>

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Special Controls for Effects"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Special Controls for Effects</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Many effects have similar controls such as presets and shape boxes.  These
are explained below.

<br><br>
<a name="Presets"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Presets</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Presets store parameters and shapes (described below) in the
gwpreset.ini file so they can be recalled again the next time
the effect is used.  Controls for presets consist of a drop down list
box, a <strong>[+]</strong> add button, a<strong> [-]</strong> remove button, and sometimes a <strong>[/]</strong>
clear button, as shown in Figure 8.

<br><br>
<p>	To add a new preset:

<p>	
<ol>
  <li> Enter in all the new parameters and/or draw the new shape.</li>
  <li> Type in a new name for the preset in the drop down list.
This name cannot be the same as one currently in the list.</li>
  <li> Choose the <strong>[+]</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

<p>	To delete a preset:

<p>
<ol>
  <li> Select the preset from the drop down list.</li>
  <li> Choose the <strong>[-]</strong> button.</li>
</ol>


<p>	To change a preset:

<p>	
<ol>
  <li> Delete the preset, as above.  When you delete a preset, the
current parameters and name remain on the screen so they
can be changed.</li>
  <li> Change the parameters and/or name.</li>
  <li> Add the preset, as above.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

<p><center><img src="figure08.png" width="670" height="417" align="center" alt="Special Controls for Effects"><br>
Figure 8: Special Controls for Effects</center>

<a name="Shape Controls"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Shape Controls</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Several effects in GoldWave use Shape Controls to set graphical
parameters or dynamically alter the effect across the selection.
Shape Controls usually consists of a graph window and presets.

<br><br>
<p>	The graph window initially contains a single line with two
endpoints (shown as large dots).  By clicking the left mouse button
anywhere inside this window, you can add new points to bend the
line into a variety of zigzag shapes.  To move a point, click on it
and drag it to a new location.  To remove a point, click the right
mouse button over the point.  The clear button removes all the
points and reset the end points.  Note that endpoints cannot be
removed.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Doppler"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Doppler</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>A Doppler effect is defined as a change in frequency of a wave caused by
motion.  It is often  heard during auto racing when a fast car passes in front
of you.  The pitch of the engine appears to drop as the car speeds away.

<br><br>
<p>In GoldWave the Doppler command dynamically alters or bends the pitch
of the selection.  Shape Controls are presented where the pitch can be varied
over the selection from 0.5 to 1.5 times normal.  You can use
<strong>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume&nbsp;|&nbsp;Shape</strong> to dynamically alter the volume as well.

<br><br>
<p>The "Power loss" preset gives you a good idea of what it sounds like when
the batteries start to fail in a portable tape player.  Other presets can change
your voice to a smurf or a giant.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Dynamics"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Dynamics</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Dynamics alters the amplitude mapping of the selection.  It can limit,
compress, or expand a range of amplitudes.  The amplitude mapping is set
using Shape Controls, where x-axis and y-axis both have a range of -1 to 1. 
When the line stretches diagonally from the lower left corner to the upper
right corner, the input amplitude (x) and output amplitude (y) are the same
for every point on the line.  By changing the line, the output will differ from
the input.

<br><br>

<p><center><img src="figure09.png" width="191" height="186" align="center" alt="Dynamics"><br>
Figure 9: Dynamics</center>

<p>Figure 9 shows an example of amplitude mapping for clipping distortion.
Point <strong>P<sub>1</sub></strong> has an input value of -0.4 and an output value of -0.4.  Therefore
no change occurs to the amplitude.  Point <strong>P<sub>2</sub></strong> on the other hand, has an input
value of 0.8 and an output value of 0.5.  In this example, all input
amplitudes in the range of -0.5 to 0.5 remain unchanged.  Any values
outside this range will be limited to &#177;0.5, so that the final sound will have
no amplitude magnitudes greater than 0.5.  Essentially, any values that are
too high are "clipped" to fit within the range.

<br><br>
<p>In practical terms, dynamics can increase the volume of quiet sections of a
sound without greatly increasing the loud sections as well.  It can introduce
mild or heavy distortion effects (such as the "Blare" or "Level noise"
preset).

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Echo"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Echo</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Echo produces an echo or reverb effect in the selection.  The echo delay,
volume, and reverb parameters can be entered after choosing this command. 
The delay determines how long it takes for the echo to bounce back.  Try
values less than 0.1 for a large room, 0.3 for a baseball stadium, above 0.5
for a canyon echo.  The volume controls how loud the echo will be. Values
less than 50 give good results.

<br><br>
<p>Reverb makes the echo sound deeper and richer.  If you check the <strong>Reverb</strong>
box, the echo will be regenerated at intervals specified by the delay.  This
means that if the delay was 0.1 seconds, the echo at 0.1s is regenerated at
0.2s, and this new echo is regenerated at 0.3s, and so on.  The volume is
applied to each regeneration.  If the volume was 50%, the first echo volume
is one half the original, the second echo volume is one quarter, and so on.

<br><br>
<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
To make the echo sound correct, the effect extends slightly outside
the end of the selection.  This may increase the length of the sound
or alter sound outside the selection.

<br><br>
<p>To add an echo:

<ol>
  <li> Move the start and finish markers to the part of the sound you want
to add an echo.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Echo</strong> from the <strong>Effects</strong> menu.</li>
  <li> Enter the delay time.</li>
  <li> Enter the volume.</li>
  <li> Check <strong>Reverb</strong> if preferred.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Expand/Compress"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Expand/Compress</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The Expand/Compress effect is a general purpose dynamics processor
that includes compressors, limiters, expanders and gates.
Compressors and limiters are used to decrease or limit the dynamic
range of audio.  They reduce the volume of loud sounds while
leaving the rest of the sound unchanged.
Expanders and gates are used to increase the dynamic range of audio.
They reduce or eliminate quiet sections, which can help to reduce
background noise.

<p>Compressors always work on loud sections and expanders
always work on quiet sections.  Normally, both compressors and
expanders only reduce the volumes.  However, GoldWave also allows
you to boost the volume.

<p>The <strong>Ratio</strong> specifies the compression or expansion ratio.
For compression, this value should be less than 100%, typically between
25% and 75%.  It essentially defines the scale factor of the loud volumes.
For a limiter, use a value less than 10%.

<p>For expansion, the value should be less than 100% as well.  It defines
the scale factor of the quiet volumes.  To boost the
quiet volumes, use a value greater than 100%.  For a gate, use a
value of 0%.  For those with a technical background, note that this is the
opposite of how a standard expander works, but it makes the ratio more
consistent between compression and expansion.  This way, a value less
than 100% always decreases volumes and a value greater than 100% always
increases them.

<p>The <strong>Threshold</strong> specifies the envelope level to activate the
expander or compressor.  Compressors change the volume level
of all sounds above that level.  Expanders change the volume level
of all sounds below that level.  Depending on the <strong>Smoothness</strong>
setting, the threshold may have to be set much lower than expected.


<p>The <strong>Smoothness</strong> specifies how quickly the compressor/expander
changes from one volume level to the next and how quickly it
activates.  Using 0% means that volumes will change instantly, which
can cause a rough distortion in sections of audio that border on
the threshold level.  A value of 100% means that volumes
will change gradually over 100ms.  With a high smoothness setting,
the threshold will have to be reduced.  The higher setting makes the
envelope detector respond more slowly to changes in the sound,
resulting in a lower envelope range.

<p>Use the <strong>Expander</strong> and <strong>Compressor</strong>
options to specify what processing is required.

<p><strong>Compressor Example</strong>

<p>You have recorded some music that has a few loud moments, but you want
to raise the overall volume without distorting the loud
parts.  With the <strong>Compressor</strong> option selected, use
25% as the ratio, 0.200 as the threshold and a smoothness of 50%.  To
compress loud volumes even more, lower the ratio or lower the threshold.
After compression, use the
<a href="#Maximize (Normalize)">Volume | Maximize</a>
command to stretch the volume to the full dymanic range.

<p><strong>Expander Example</strong>

<p>You have recorded someone talking and notice background noise
during the quiet parts.  To reduce the noise, use the <strong>Expander</strong>
option, 5% as the ratio, 0.050 as the threshold and a smoothness of 50%.

<a name="Filter"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Filter</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Filters are used to remove a range of frequencies from a sound and can
produce a variety of effects.  A submenu is displayed listing several filter
related commands.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Noise gate"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Noise gate</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Noise gates remove background hiss or noise from quiet parts of
the selection.  You can use this after recording to clean up some of
the noise created by the audio device when it converted the sound
to digital data.  This works well for voice recordings where there
are frequent "silences" between words.  Noise gates do not remove
background hiss from louder parts of the selection, making them
unsuitable for music.

<br><br>
<p>	The Attack time is the amount of time (in milliseconds) that it takes
for the noise gate to fully close.  When the gate is closed, no sound
can pass and this leaves only silence.  Start with a value of about
200 milliseconds or less.

<br><br>
<p>	The Release time is the amount of time (in milliseconds) that it
takes for the noise gate to fully open.  A value of 50 or less usually
gives good results.

<br><br>
<p>	The Threshold is the amplitude level at which the gate will start to
open and let sound pass.  If you specify a value of 0.05, for
example, all samples with levels from 0.05 to 1.0 will be allowed
to pass.  Samples with levels 0 to 0.05 are blocked.  If you still
notice a hiss in quiet sections, increase this value and decrease the
attack time.

<br><br>
<p>	The Anticipation settings allows the noise gate to predict when the
gate should open or close.  This significantly reduces the problem
associated with analog noise gates where the beginning of the sound
is chopped off during the time it takes to release the gate.  A value
of 10 makes the noise gate look 10&nbsp;ms head.  In general, it is best
to set this value equal to the Release time.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Noise reduction"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Noise reduction</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Noise reduction uses frequency analysis techniques to remove
unwanted noise from a sound, such as a background hiss, a power
hum, or random interference.  It cannot be used to separate or
remove complex sounds, such as removing vocals from music or a
cough from a speech.

<br><br>
<p>	The interface (Figure 10) includes a frequency analysis window,
with a shape line, and several other controls.  The Coordinates
group show the x and y coordinates when you click-and-drag a
shape point.  The x coordinate is the frequency in Hertz and the y
coordinate is the magnitude in decibels.

<br><br>
<p><center><img src="figure10.png" width="563" height="337" align="center" alt="Noise Reduction"><br>
Figure 10: Noise Reduction</center>

<p>The time of the frequency analysis is given as T, in seconds.  If you
adjust the scroll bar located below the analysis window, the analysis
time can be changed to show the frequency analysis of a different
part of the sound.  The width of the analysis depends on the FFT
size setting, explained below.

<br><br>
<p>	Noise is removed using a reduction envelope.  The shape of the
envelope should closely match the shape of the noise you want to
remove.  The frequency analysis graph can help determine that
shape.  Adjust the analysis time so that it coincides with a time in
the sound where only the noise is heard (play the file to find such
a place and time).  Once you have isolated the noise in the analysis
graph, you then create the envelope.  The envelope can be created
in four different ways, depending on the <strong>Reduction envelope</strong>
setting:

<br><br>
<p><strong> Use shape</strong>

<p> Lets you manually create an envelope shape or select a
preset shape.  See <strong>Shape Controls</strong> for information about
creating shapes.  By creating a horizontal line at about 75
dB, you can remove a hiss from a sound.

<br><br>
<p> <strong>Use current spectrum</strong>

<p> Creates an envelope based on the shape of the graph shown
in the frequency analysis window.  This is particularly
useful for removing a complex buzz or hum.

<br><br>
<p> <strong>Use average</strong>

<p> Applies an averaging envelope throughout noise reduction
processing.  The envelope is continuously updated, based
on the frequency analysis of the sound. Use this setting if
the noise changes frequently throughout the sound.

<br><br>
<p> <strong>Use clipboard</strong>

<p> Creates an envelope based on an analysis of the waveform in the
clipboard.  This is the most flexible option and usually gives the
best results.  Before you can use this
option, you must
use <strong>Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Copy</strong> to copy a piece of noise
into the clipboard.  For best results, the piece should contain only
the noise you want to remove from the rest of the file.  The noise
can even be copied from a different file.  After you copy
the noise, remember to change the selection to the part of the
file you want to apply the noise reduction.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Settings</strong>

<p>	The FFT size determines the detail of the frequency analysis and the
noise reduction envelope.  Usually values between 9 to 11 give the
best results.  The Overlap value specifies the percentage of the FFT
size to overlap from one calculation to the next.  A value of 75 is
best.  The Scale value lets you alter the reduction envelope scale.
A value of 100 uses the envelope as it is.  A value of 200 doubles
the envelope, which doubles the amount audio removed from the
sound.  A value of 50 halves the envelope, which halves the amount
removed.  Normally it should be set to 100.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Low/Highpass"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Low/Highpass</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Lowpass filters block high pitched frequencies (treble), but allow
low pitched frequencies (bass) to pass.  They can be used to reduce
high end hiss noise or remove unwanted sounds above the given
cutoff frequency.  If you were to apply a lowpass filter with a cutoff
frequency of 1000&nbsp;Hz on speech, it would make it sound mumbled
and deep.  Lowpass filters can also be used to eliminate aliasing
noise when used before downsampling.

<br><br>
<p>	Highpass filters block low pitch frequencies, but allow high pitched
frequencies to pass.  They can remove deep rumbling hum or
remove unwanted sounds below the given cutoff frequency.  If you
were to apply a highpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1000&nbsp;Hz
on speech, it would make it sound thin and hollow.

<br><br>
<p>		<strong>Cutoff frequency</strong>

<p>		The <strong>Initial</strong> box specifies the constant cutoff frequency for
static filtering.  If the <strong>Dynamic</strong> option is selected (see
below), then a final cutoff frequency can be given in the
<strong>Final</strong> box.

<br><br>
<p>		<strong>Filter options</strong>

<p>		Select <strong>Lowpass</strong> if you want to keep only the frequencies
below the cutoff frequency.  Select <strong>Highpass</strong> if you want
to keep only the frequencies above the cutoff frequency.

<br><br>
<p>		If you want the cutoff frequency to remain constant
throughout the selection during processing, select the
<strong>Static</strong> option.  If you want the cutoff frequency to change
from the initial value to the final value, select the <strong>Dynamic</strong>
option.  Note that dynamic filtering will take more
processing time.

<br><br>
<p>		The <strong>Steepness</strong> value specifies how sharply the filter cuts
off frequencies outside the cutoff frequency.  A higher
steepness makes the filter sharper, but it also increases
processing time.  In technical terms, the steepness specifies
the number of second order cascade filters used.

<br><br>
<p>		<strong>Examples</strong>

<p>		To make speech gradually become more hollow and thin:

<p>
<ol>
  <li> Enter 60 in the <strong>Initial</strong> box.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Dynamic</strong>.</li>
  <li> Enter 1000 in the <strong>Final</strong> box.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Highpass</strong>.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>OK</strong>.</li>

<br><br>
<p>		<strong>Frequency range</strong>

<p>		The <strong>From</strong> and <strong>To</strong> boxes specify the frequency range of the

<a name="Equalizer"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Equalizer</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Equalizers are commonly found on stereo systems.  They boost or
reduces certain ranges of frequencies.  Simple equalizers control
only treble and bass.  GoldWave's equalizer (Figure 11) controls 7
bands.

<br><br>
<p><center><img src="figure11.png" width="386" height="308" align="center" alt="Equalizer"><br>
Figure 11: Equalizer</center>

<p>Center frequencies for each of the 7-bands are given at the top of
each scroll bar.  Adjust the scroll bars to boost or reduce a band by
+12 dB to -24 dB.

<br><br>
<p>	To change bass, adjust the two or three left-most bands.  To change
treble, adjust the two or three right-most bands.  Several presets are
included to demonstrate bass and treble changes.

<br><br>
<p>	More detailed equalization is possible using the Parametric EQ,
described below.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Parametric EQ"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Parametric EQ</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	A parametric equalizer (Figure 12) is a flexible tool for reducing or
enhancing ranges of frequencies.  GoldWave presents an easy to use
interface where all the parameters for up to 30 band can be
configured quickly.  The Presets contain some commonly used
settings.

<p>		<strong>Graph window</strong>

<p>		The graph shows frequency on the x-axis in Hertz and the
gain on the y-axis in decibels.  Each enabled band is
displayed in the graph as a diamond shaped box located at
its center frequency and gain.  The width of the box shows
the bandwidth.  The currently selected band is shown in
blue and its exact settings are given in edit box controls.

<br><br>
<p>		A short time frequency analysis graph is drawn with the
left channel in green and the right channel in red.  The time
of the analysis can be changed using the scroll bar located
at the bottom of the graph.  The analysis can be used to
determine what frequencies to attenuate or intensify.

<br><br>
<p>		<strong>Controls</strong>

<p>		A band is configured by selecting its number from the
<strong>Select band</strong> box and adjusting the scroll bars.  A quicker
way is to <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> the band to a new location on the
graph.  Note that because of the logarithmic frequency
scale, the width of a diamond changes as you move it left
or right.  The bandwidth, however, remains constant.

<br><br>
<p>		Any unneeded bands can be disabled by unchecking the
<strong>Enabled</strong> box.  Disabling unused bands improves
processing speed.

<br><br>
<p>	The "Notch" preset is effective for removing a specific tone from
a sound, such as a 60&nbsp;Hz hum.  The "Bass boost" and "Treble
boost" presets work the same way as the bass and treble controls on
a stereo system.  Just adjust the gain up or down to control them.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Pop/Click"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Pop/Click</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	A pop/click filter is a specially designed filter that searches for
abrupt changes in the sound and eliminates them.  Such a filter is
often used to remove pops and clicks caused by dust and scratches
when recording old vinyl records.

<p> The <strong>Tolerance</strong> defines how abrupt a change can be before it
is considered a click.  It is best to start with a value near 1000%.
Using a lower value will detect more clicks, but may eliminate
natural clicks such as drum sticks tapping together or a conductor
tapping the baton.  Values less than 500% should be used on short
selections only.

<p>When a click is detected, the filter attempts to reconstruct the damaged
waveform based on the surrounding waveform shape making the repair almost
imperceptible.  However with excessive pops and clicks or at low tolerance
levels, reconstructed waveforms may overlap and sound distorted.  The
tolerance setting should be kept as high as possible.  Using a very low
setting may introduce more distortion than existed in the original.

<p>The filter requires a minimum selection of 4000 samples (about one tenth of
a second at CD quality) to establish a base line.  Using the filter on a
shorter selection has no effect.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="User defined"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>User defined</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	The User Defined Filter dialog allows you to specify coefficients
to use for filtering.  Up to 15 coefficients can be given.  Almost any
kind of linear filter can be created with this command because it
exploits the general digital filter equation:

<p><center><img src="eqx1.png" width="229" height="61" align="center" alt="Filter Equation"></center>

<p>In GoldWave, this becomes:

<br><br>
<p>		<em>b(0)y(n)+b(1)y(n-1)+ ... +b(14)y(n-14) =
a(0)x(n)+a(1)x(n-1)+ ... +a(14)x(n-14)</em>

<br><br>
<p>	The number of coefficients entered for <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> must be the same. 
For FIR filters, you would usually enter a one followed by a
number of zeros for <strong>b</strong>.

<br><br>
<p>	<img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
You can use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to copy and paste
coefficients in the edit boxes.  The <strong>Clear</strong> button quickly
removes all coefficients.

<br><br>
<p>	Some predefined filters are included in the <strong>Coefficient Sets</strong>.  The
number following a lowpass filter preset indicates what percentage
of frequencies are kept.  Lowpass 25, for example, keeps the lower
25% of frequencies.  The number following a highpass filter preset
indicates the percentage discarded.  Highpass 10, for example,
discards the lower 10% of frequencies.  The actual frequencies kept
or discarded depends on the sampling rate of the sound.  Lowpass
25 on a 22050&nbsp;Hz sound will remove frequencies from about
2700&nbsp;Hz to 11025&nbsp;Hz.

<br><br>
<p>	<img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
To fully use this command requires detailed knowledge of
digital filter theory, which is beyond the scope of this
manual.  A brief introduction is provided in <strong><a href="#Appendix: Expression Evaluator">Appendix C</a></strong>.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Flange"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Flange</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>A flanging effect is similar to an echo effect in that the original sound can
be mixed with a delayed copy of itself.  Unlike an echo, where the delay is
constant, flanging varies the delay over a specified range or <em>depth</em>.  The
speed, or <em>frequency</em>, at which the delay varies can be controlled as well.  In
GoldWave, the Flange effect presents a dialog where you can set the depth,
frequency, and fixed delay parameters and define how the sound should be
mixed.  Several presets are included to demonstrate the kinds of unusual
audio effects that are possible with flanging.

<br><br>
<p>	The Input volume specifies the volume of the original sound to mix
with the final sound.  A value of 0 means the original sound will
not be mixed with the final sound.  If this value is set to 100 and all
other volumes are 0, no change will be made to the sound.  A value
of -100 simply inverts the input, which is equivalent to subtracting
the original instead of adding it to the final sound.

<br><br>
<p>	The Mix volume specifies the volume of the flanged (delayed)
sound to mix with the final sound.  Usually, this value should be in
the range of 50 to 100, or -50 to -100 for an inverted mix.

<br><br>
<p>	Feedback specifies the level of feedback to mix with the final
sound.  This makes the effect sound more pronounced.  Set this
value to 0 if you do not want any feedback.  In general the feedback
should be set to between -75 to 75.

<br><br>
<p>	Depth specifies the maximum variable delay in milliseconds.  A
value of 40 will allow the delay to vary from 0 to 40 milliseconds.

<br><br>
<p>	Frequency specifies how fast to vary the delay.  A value of 2 will
vary the delay over its depth twice a second.  For a value of 0.2, the
full delay depth is reached every five seconds.

<br><br>
<p>	The Fixed delay is added to the depth to change the minimum
delay.  If the depth is 40 and the fixed delay is 10, the delay will
vary from 10 to 50 milliseconds.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Interpolate"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Interpolate</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Interpolate (Figure 13) uses linear interpolation to smooth out samples
between the start and finish markers.  Use this command on a tiny selection
to remove a pop or click.

<br><br>
<p><center><img src="figure13.png" width="344" height="140" align="center" alt="Interpolate"><br>

<br><br>
<a name="Invert"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Invert</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Invert reflects the selection about the time axis.  The selection is essentially
turned upside-down.  This produces no noticeable effect in mono sounds
and has a slight effect in stereo sounds.  Inverting a single channel of a
stereo sound produces an "in" or "out" effect.

<br><br>
<p>Inverting can be used before mixing so that the two sounds are subtracted
instead of added.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Mechanize"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Mechanize</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Mechanize adds a robotic or mechanical characteristic to sounds.  The
percentage of quality can be entered after selecting this command.  Low
values produce an untuned radio effect.  Higher values give a rough
distorted effect.

<br><br>
<p>To mechanize part of a sound:

<ol>
  <li> Move the start and finish markers to the part of the sound you want
to mechanize.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Mechanize</strong> from the <strong>Effects</strong> menu.</li>
  <li> Enter the quality percentage, then choose <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<br><br>

<a name="Offset"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Offset</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Offset adjusts or removes a dc offset in the selection by shifting it up or
down (Figure 14) so that the wave is centered on the horizontal axis.

<br><br>
<p><center><img src="figure14.png" width="357" height="142" align="center" alt="Offset"><br>
Figure 14: Offset</center>
<br><br>

<p>When this command is selected, it first scans the selection for any existing
offset.  An offset to cancel the existing one is then displayed in a dialog
where it can be changed.  A positive value shifts the graph up and a negative
value shifts it down.  If a value of 0 is displayed, the sound does not have
an offset.

<br><br>
<p>An offset in a waveform should be removed to minimize pops/clicks during
editing.  Offsets may adversely affect other effects.

<br><br>
<p>To adjust the offset of part of a sound:

<ol>
  <li> Move the start and finish markers to the part of the sound you want
to adjust.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Offset</strong> from the <strong>Effects</strong> menu.</li>
  <li> Enter the offset, then choose <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
When removing an offset from a stereo sound, use the
<strong>Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Channel</strong> submenu to change each channel separately.  Stereo
sounds often have different offsets on the left and right channels.

<br><br>
<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
You should check the offset from time to time after processing
effects.  Otherwise, the offset may increase with each effect,
resulting in distortion.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Pitch"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Pitch</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Pitch changes the pitch (frequency) of the selection.  This is useful for
converting instrument samples from one note to another.  The new pitch is
specified using a scale factor or using semitone and fine tune values.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Scale</strong>

<p>	This option scales the pitch by the value you specify.  If you set the
scale to 0.5, that will be equivalent to a downward shift by one
octave.  A value of 2.0 is the same as an upward shift of one octave
and would make a voice sound like a chipmunk.  A value of 0.75
would make a woman's voice sound like a man's.

<br><br>
<p><strong>	Semitone</strong>

<p>	This option changes the pitch by semitones (notes on a piano).  If
your sound is a note at middle C and the semitone value is 2, the
note will be changed to D.  A value of -1 changes the note to B.  A
value of 12 make the note one octave above middle C.  The Fine
tune value lets you make a slight pitch adjustment in hundredths of
a semitone.  For example, a value of 50 changes a note from C to
halfway between C and C#.

<br><br>
<p><strong>	Preserve length</strong>

<p>	If this option is checked, a complex algorithm will be used to keep
the length of the original note the same as the new note.  In other
words, the tempo will not be changed.  In terms of a voice
recording, this changes the pitch of the voice without changing the
speed at which the words are spoken.  This option requires a
substantial amount of processing time and will affect the quality of
the sound.

<br><br>
<p>	The FFT size determines how much of the sound to process at one
time, based on a power of 2.  A value of 10, for example means
that 1024 (2<sup>10</sup>) samples will be processed at a time.  Values from 9
to 11 give good results.  The Overlap determines what percentage
of the processed samples will be recalculated.  It should be at least
88.  Values of 90 and 95 will give better results, but require more
processing time.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Reverse"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Reverse</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>This command reverses the selection so that it plays backward.  Now you
have an easy way to listen to all those "satanic verses" or reverse speech
messages.  You can play a sound backwards by using the rewind button on
the Device Controls window as well.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Silence"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Silence</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The Silence command erases the selection.  The sound in the selection is
replaced with silence.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Stereo"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Stereo</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The Stereo submenu contains commands that apply to stereo files, such as
swapping channels and left/right panning.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Exchange channels"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Exchange channels</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	This command exchanges the left and right channels of a stereo
sound  (i.e. the right channel becomes the left channel and the left
channel becomes the right channel).

<br><br>
<a name="Pan"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Pan</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Pan presents the Shape Controls where left and right panning can
be controlled.  The graph is divided into green and red regions,
representing the left and right channels respectively.  The line,
initially located between the regions, represents the center for
panning.  By bending and/or moving the line, you can dynamically
alter the selection's left/right balance or pan to and from each
channel.  Figures 15 to 17 show several examples of panning
shapes.

<a name="Remove vocals"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Remove vocals</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	This effect removes vocals from certain stereo recording by
subtracting the left and right channels.  This works <em>only</em> when
vocals are located in the exact center of the stereo image.  Note that
any instruments located in the center will be removed as well.  After
processing, the stereo image is lost and the final output will sound
monaural.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Time warp"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Time warp</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Time warp (Figure 18) changes the playback speed or alters the tempo of
the selection.  This effect has many uses: it can stretch or compress a sound
to fit in a certain time, it can slow down instrumental music for easy
transcription, or it can change the tempo of one musical passage to match
rhythm and beats of another.

<br><br>
<p>Three different techniques are provided, each with certain advantages and
disadvantages.  All three let you specify the change either by a speed factor
or by a new length.  The Speed factor lets you specify a relative change.  A
value of 0.5 make the selection play twice as slow. A value of 2.0 make the
selection play twice as fast.  The Time options lets you specify a new length
for the selection. This is useful if you need to make a sound fit a certain
time, such as squeezing a 35 second commercial into a 30 second spot.

<br><br>
<p><center><img src="figure18.png" width="400" height="289" align="center" alt="Time Warp"><br>
Figure 18: Time Warp</center>

<p>	<strong>Speed</strong>

<p>	Speed changes the sampling rate of the entire sound so that it plays
back at a different speed, similar to spinning a vinyl record faster
or slower.  It works the same way as the speed scroll bar in the
Device Controls window, but in this case, the sound itself is
changed.  This technique is very fast and produces excellent quality,
however, the pitch of the sound is changed as well.  In other words,
if you were to speed up a voice, the pitch becomes higher, making
the voice sound like a chipmunk.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Similarity</strong>

<p>	Similarity uses correlation to add and overlap small, similar
sections of the sound.  This technique preserves the pitch.  It
generally produces high quality voice and fair quality music when
using small speed or time changes.  A fair amount of time may be
require for processing, depending on the Search range value.  For
voice, the Window size should be set between 20 and 30 and the
Search range set to between 5 and 10.  For music, a larger Window
size and Search range gives better results, such as 50 and 25.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>FFT</strong>

<p>	FFT uses Fourier transforms and interpolates or decimates the
frequency analysis to change the length.  This technique preserves
the pitch, but can introduce some artifacts into the sound.  Best
quality is obtained by using the Oscillator synthesis option, but that
requires significant processing time.  The FFT size should be set
from 9 to 11 and the Overlap should be at least 75, but can be set
to 88, 90, or 95 for better quality.  The FFT size and Overlap
settings are explained under the Noise reduction filter section.

<br><br>
<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
If you changed the Device Controls playback speed, remember to
set it back to 1.00 so that the device plays at the correct speed.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Volume"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Volume</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The Volume submenu contains several volume related commands.  Volumes
are usually specified by a percentage of the sound's original amplitude.  A
value of 200 doubles the volume and a value of 50 halves the volume.
Unlike the volume scroll bar in the Device Controls window, which changes
the audio device output volume, these commands alter the sound's data to
change the volume.

<br><br>
<p>To convert gain in dB to a percentage, use the formula:

<p><center><img src="eqx2.png" width="277" height="49" align="center" alt="Volume Formula"><br>
</center>

<br><br>
<a name="Change"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Change</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	This command modifies the selection so that it sounds louder or
quieter.  You need to enter the new relative volume.  Values less
than 100 make the selection quieter.  Values greater than 100 make
it louder.  A value of 100 is normal volume and has no effect.

<p> If you are trying to make the volumes of several different songs
sound the same, use
<strong>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume&nbsp;|&nbsp;Maximize</strong> to
obtain the rms value for each song.  You can then use this
effect to scale the volume by the appropriate amount.  If the required
rms value is 0.25 and it currently is 0.20, the change would be
0.25 / 0.20 = 1.25 or 125%.

<br><br>
<p>	To double the volume of part of a sound:

<p>
<ol>
  <li> Move the start and finish markers to the part of the sound
you want to change.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Change</strong> from the <strong>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume</strong> submenu.</li>
  <li> Enter <strong>200</strong> for the volume percentage, then choose <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Fade in"></a>
<p>	<strong><font size="+1">Fade in</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Fade in gradually increases the volume throughout the selection. 
You need to specify the initial volume percentage.  A value of 25
starts with one quarter volume and fades in to full volume.  A value
of 0 starts at silence and fades in to full volume.

<br><br>
<p>	To fade in part of a sound from silence:

<p>	
<ol>
  <li> Move the start and finish markers to the part of the sound
you want to fade in.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Fade in</strong> from the <strong>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume</strong> submenu.</li>
  <li> Enter <strong>0</strong> for the initial volume, then choose <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
<br><br>

<a name="Fade out"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Fade out</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Fade out gradually decreases the volume throughout the selection.
You need to specify the percentage of fade.  The fade percentage
is the amount that the volume should decrease.  A value of 100
fades to complete silence.  A value of 50 fades to half the original
volume.

<br><br>
<p>	To completely fade out part of a sound:

<p>	
<ol>
  <li> Move the start and finish markers to the part of the sound
you want to fade out.</li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Fade out</strong> from the <strong>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume</strong> submenu.</li>
  <li> Enter <strong>100</strong> for the fade percentage, then choose <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
<br><br>

<a name="Maximize (Normalize)"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Maximize (Normalize)</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Maximize searches the selection for the current maximum volume
level.  It then displays the level, the position of the level within the
file, and the RMS (root-mean-square) level.  You can then specify a
new maximum volume level.  The volume of the entire selection is
changed so that the maximum will match that value.  This is often
referred to as "normalizing".

<br><br>
<p>	The RMS value indicates of the overall volume of the selection. If
you want two separate sounds to have a similar volume, you can
adjust the RMS value of one sound so that it matches that of
the other.  To choose the best RMS value to use, scan each sound
and either calculate the overal average or just choose the minimum.
Choosing the minimum RMS value ensures that no clipping distortion
will result from the change.

<br><br>
<p>	To maximize to full volume a part of a sound:

<p>
<ol>
  <li> Move the start and finish markers to the part of the sound
you want to normalize.</li>

<a name="Shape"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>Shape</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	Shape presents the Shape Controls where the volume envelope of
the selection can be defined.  The shape line is initially horizontal
at 100, representing normal volume.  By bending or moving the
line, you can dynamically change the volume over the selection.
Adding a point below 100 decreases the volume.  Adding a point
above 100, in the red section, increases the volume.  Note that
increasing the volume may cause clipping distortion.  Several preset
shapes are included.  The "Exp fade out" and "Exp fade in" presets
demonstrate customized fading.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Playback rate"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Playback rate</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>This command changes the playback rate of the <em>entire</em> sound.  The sound
will play faster (or slower) and its pitch will be higher (or lower). 
Essentially, this just changes the first number in the status bar.  Values of
11025, 22050, and 44100 are recommended.

<br><br>
<p>To change the playback rate of the entire sound:

<ol>
  <li> Choose <strong>Playback rate</strong> from the <strong>Effects</strong> menu.</li>
  <li> Enter the new rate, then choose <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
The playback rate of the audio device can be controlled using the
speed fader in the Device Controls window.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Resample"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Resample</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Resample changes the sampling rate of the <em>entire</em> sound.  Unlike <strong>Playback
rate</strong>, this command re-calculates and interpolates all the data so that the
pitch and playback time are not affected.  This command is useful for
converting any sampling rate to the standard CD rate of 44100&nbsp;Hz or the
standard telephony rate of 8000&nbsp;Hz. You are prompted to enter a new rate. 


<p>To change the sampling rate of the entire sound:

<ol>
  <li> Choose <strong>Resample</strong> from the <strong>Effects</strong> menu.</li>
  <li> Enter the new rate, then choose <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
If you have a sound recorded at 44100&nbsp;Hz and do not need CD
quality, you can save large amounts of disk space by resampling the
sound to 22050Hz or 11025Hz.  This reduces the size by 2:1 or 4:1.
Before down-sampling (converting 22050&nbsp;Hz to 11025&nbsp;Hz, for
example), the data should be lowpass filtered to prevent aliasing.
See <strong>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Filter</strong>.

<font size="+2"><strong>View Menu Commands</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>This section assumes that you are familiar with the terms introduced in the
<a href="#Interface Overview">Interface Overview</a> and
<a href="#Editing Overview">Editing Overview</a> sections.

<br><br>
<p>View commands allow you to see a more detailed graph of part of the
sound.  They are similar to zoom commands in the Windows Paint
accessory.  When you zoom in (or magnify) the sound, you see a smaller
section, but with greater detail.  When zoomed out, you see the entire sound,
but with less detail.  The Overview box near the bottom of each Sound
window gives you some information about what section of the sound is
currently shown in the view (see Figure 1).

<br><br>
<p>When zoomed in to a part of the sound, a scroll bar will appear at the
bottom of the Sound window so you can move to different parts of the
sound while still keeping the same level of magnification.  The current level
of magnification is displayed in the Main window's status bar next to the
word "Zoom".

<br><br>
<p>Most view commands use the start marker's position as the starting location
for magnification, so you should move the start marker to the position of
interest first.

<br><br>
<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
Note that if a file is flash opened, only part of the sound is initially
display in the view.  Otherwise, the entire sound is displayed.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="All"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">All</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>The entire sound is graphed in the view.  In other words, it zooms all the
way out so that the entire sound is visible.  You can move the start and
finish markers to select any part of the sound.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Other"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Other</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>This magnifies the graph to any level you specify.  The level is given as 1:<em>X</em>,
where <em>X</em> is the number you enter in the box.  A value of 10 gives a 1:10
level as described below.  A value of 0.10 is equivalent to a detailed 10:1
zoom level.  If the given level is not possible, the closest valid level is used.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Previous zoom"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Previous zoom</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>This returns the view to the previous zoom level.  Use this to switch
back and forward between two different zoom levels.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Selection"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Selection</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>The selection is magnified, increasing the detail of the graph (Figure 19).  You can
zoom in many times by changing the selection and magnifying it again until
only a single sample is shown in the view.

<br><br>
<p>A <strong>User</strong> button is provided in the tool bar so that you can quickly zoom to
your favourite level. The sound is magnified to the level of detail specified
under the <strong>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Window</strong> dialog.  The level can be set to any value you
find convenient.

<br><br>
<a name="Zoom in"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Zoom in</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>Magnifies the sound by a factor of 1.33x.  This gives 33% more detail, but
shows 33% less sound.  The middle of the view is used as the zoom focus. 
This command complements Zoom out.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Zoom out"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Zoom out</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>Reduces magnification by a factor of 1.33x.  This gives 33% less detail, but
shows 33% mode sound.  The middle of the view is used as the zoom focus. 
This command complements Zoom in.

<br><br>
<a name="Zoom 10:1 and 5:1"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Zoom 10:1 and 5:1</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>When the number to the left of the colon is greater than one, a very small
section of sound is magnified at a high level of detail.  At these levels,
individual samples are easily visible and direct waveform editing with the
mouse is possible.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Zoom 1:1"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Zoom 1:1</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>At a level of 1:1, each audio sample is represented as a single pixel on the
screen.  This reveals a true representation of the shape of the sound.

<br><br>
<br><br>

<p><strong><font size="+1">Zoom 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>When the number to right of the colon is greater than one, a larger section
of sound is displayed, but with less detail. Levels beyond 1:10 show only
an approximation of the shape of the sound with minimum detail.

<br><br>
<a name="Vertical zoom all"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Vertical zoom all</strong></font>

<p><font size="+1"><strong>Vertical zoom in</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Magnifies the graph vertically to show 1.33x as much amplitude detail.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Vertical zoom out"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Vertical zoom out</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Reduces vertical magnification to show 1.33x less amplitude detail.  This

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Start and Finish"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Start and Finish</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>These commands scroll the view to either the start or finish marker's
position.  The view will be centered over the marker's position provided its
position and the level of magnification permit it to be centered.  These
commands are especially useful when you need to move a marker to a
precise position.  For example, you can zoom in 1:1 and move the start
marker to an exact position and then use <strong>View&nbsp;|&nbsp;Finish</strong> to set the finish
marker's position.

<strong><font size="+2">Tools Menu Commands</font></strong>

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Cue points"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Cue points</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>Cue points mark and describe specific positions within sounds.  They have
numerous uses.  When recording speech, for example, you can use them to
hold information about the speaker or a translation of what the speaker said.
For music, you can store lyrics for each verse.  If you design instrument
samples, cue points can hold looping points.  Some multimedia applications
use them to play or loop specific sections of a sound.  When transferring
albums to CDs, cue points can mark track division points, which can be
used later to divide a large file into individual songs or tracks.

<br><br>
<p>Cue points can be set at the start or finish marker's position.  You can also
move the start or finish marker back to a cue point.  You can drag-and-drop
a cue point using the left mouse button.  Clicking the right mouse button
on a cue point displays a context menu.

<br><br>
<p>Currently, cue points are fixed and do not change position when a sound is
modified.  This should be considered when certain commands, such as
delete, are used.  Any cues inside the deleted selection will not be deleted
and the cues outside the selection will not be adjusted to account for the new
positions.

<br><br>
<p><img src="warn.png" width="18" height="19" align="left" alt="Warning">
Cue points are saved only in Wave files.

<p>The <strong>Split file</strong> feature divides a large file into smaller files
by using the cue points as split points.  This can be used to divide a recording
of an album into individual songs before writing to a CD-R disc as audio tracks.
The smaller files are stored in the specified <strong>Folder</strong>.
The <strong>Base name</strong> is used together with a 3 digit number to create
the name of each file.  If you entered "Track", for example, the files
would be named Track000, Track001, Track002, etc.  The
<strong>Overwrite existing files</strong> option automatically replaces files
with the same name that already exist in the folder.  The
<strong>Use CD format and alignment</strong> ensures that each
file is stored in CD compatible format and that the length of the audio
is exactly aligned to a CD sector boundry.

<p>The <strong>Mark silence</strong> button automatically searches for
and sets cue points at regions of silence.  This is very useful
for marking the silence between songs so that a file can be split into
individual songs.  When regions of silence are found that match the
given settings, cue points are set in the middle of each region.
The <strong>Silence threshold</strong> setting controls what level
should be considered silence.  Typically this should be 0.05 or 0.1 for
most recordings, depending on the background noise.  The
<strong>Minimum length</strong> setting controls how long the silent region
must be before it is marked.  To find separations between
songs, values from 1 to 1.5 seconds are best.  Applying pop/click and
noise reduction filters are recommended before using this feature.

<br><br>

<a name="CD audio extraction"></a>
<p>	<font size="+1"><strong>CD audio extraction</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>	The CD Audio Extraction tool digitally copies audio directly from
an audio CD to a file on your hard drive, without using your sound
card.  This features has several advantages over normal recording:

<p>
<ul>
  <li> There is no need to create and initialize a new file.</li>
  <li> Audio can be compressed while extracting, saving lots of
hard drive space.</li>
  <li> System noise and interference is eliminated.</li>
  <li> Recording volume controls do not have to be selected or
adjusted.</li>
  <li> Synchronizing recording with CD playback is unnecessary.</li>
  <li> Some CD-ROM drives allow extraction several times
faster than recording.</li>

<br><br></ul>

<p>	Note that only recent SCSI and ATAPI (IDE) CD-ROM devices
are supported.  For Windows 95 and 98 you must have an ASPI driver
installed.  Due to the wide variety of interfaces and
inconsistent device standards, incompatiblities may arise that will
require a system reset.  It is recommended that you close all other
programs before proceeding.

<br><br>
<p>	If your system is configured correctly, you will see a dialog that
allows you to select a CD device and specify the region of audio to
copy. If you have only one CD-ROM drive, only one device will be
listed in the drop down list.  If you already have an audio CD in the
drive, the track times will be shown in the From and To time lists.
Otherwise you will need to insert an audio CD and select the device
from the list.

<br><br>
<p>	The <strong>Preview from</strong> button plays the first five seconds beginning at
the From time.  The <strong>Preview to</strong> button plays the last five seconds
up to the To time.  Choosing the <strong>Save</strong> button will prompt you for
a filename and format and then begin extraction.

<br><br>
<p>	The Read technique group lets you manually specify what SCSI
command to use to read from your CD-ROM drive.  In some cases,
GoldWave will automatically select an appropriate technique.  In
general, you will have to try each option to see which one works on
your system.  If you have an ATAPI (IDE) CD-ROM drive, start with
the MMC option.

<br><br>
<p>	The Fix defects option helps to eliminate pops and clicks caused by
slight reading alignment errors (also know as jitter).  When enabled,
the CD is read more than once to detect and correct any errors.  If
your CD-ROM drive automatically fixes these errors (such as
Plextor or CD-R devices), you can disable this option to speed up
extraction.  When this option is enabled, you may receive synchronization
errors.  If such an error occurs at the beginning, you may have to
continue many times before synchronization is reliably established.

<br><br>
<p>	The Byte swap option changes the order of bytes (endian) extracted
from the CD-ROM.  If the audio you extracted is badly distorted or
a loud hiss, you will need to check or uncheck this box.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>

<p>	If you get synchronization errors at the beginning of extraction,
try continuing until extraction progresses normally.  If the errors
occur in the middle of extraction, the disk may be scratched or may need
to be cleaned.

<p>	If you see an error message indicating a read problem, make sure
that the CD is free of dust and finger prints.  If the CD appears
clean, try using a different read technique.  If you have tried all of
the techniques and still get an error message, then CD audio
extraction may not be supported on your system.

<p>	<strong>Sound files</strong>

<p>	This specifies the folder where you keep your sound files.  The
<strong>File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Open</strong> command automatically lists files in this folder
whenever you start GoldWave.  If you prefer to use the Windows
95 <strong>Properties</strong> feature to specify a working folder, enter a period,
"<strong>.</strong>", for this folder.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Temporary</strong>

<p>	This specifies the folder to use when creating temporary files.  This
folder should be located on a large disk with plenty of free space. 
Using a compressed drive is not recommended.  It will slow
processing and give poor results when recording if <strong>hard disk</strong>
storage is enabled.  Changing this folder does not affect opened
files already in temporary storage.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Undo</strong>

<p>	<strong>Undo</strong> specifies the folder to use for storing undo data.  In most
cases, it should be the same as the temporary folder.  Changing the
undo folder does not affect the current session of GoldWave since
the undo file will have been created already.  <strong>Undo</strong> can be enable
or disabled by checking or unchecking the check box.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Flash open</strong>

<p>	The <strong>Flash open</strong> radio buttons let you control the flash feature.  If
you usually edit small files or have a slow system, set this to <strong>Never</strong>. 
If you always play files and rarely modify them, choose <strong>Always</strong>. 
If you have a fast system and often modify files, choose <strong>Limit</strong> and
specify the minimum size (in units of 1000 samples) for a file to be
flash.  Any file larger than this will be flashed.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Temporary storage</strong>

<p>	This specifies where files should be stored for processing.  <strong>RAM</strong>
storage is usually very fast, but limits the size of files.  <strong>Hard disk</strong>
is slower, but allow huge files to be processed.  Changing this
options does not affect files already opened.

<br><br>
<p>	<strong>Clipboard</strong>

<p>	Due to size limitations in the standard Windows clipboard, copying
large sounds can cause some problems.  If you encounter any
unusual behaviour or you frequently work with large files (20
megabytes or more), choose <strong>GoldWave</strong> to use GoldWave's special
clipboard.  If you edit small files and need to copy and paste
between different applications, choose <strong>Windows</strong> to use the
standard clipboard.

<br><br>
<p>	<img src="warn.png" width="18" height="19" align="left" alt="Warning">
The standard Windows clipboard may freeze your system
when copying or pasting large audio clips.  If this happens,
use the GoldWave clipboard instead.

<br><br>
<a name="File types"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">File types</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>Use the File Types dialog (Figure 21) to associate a filename extension
(such as .snd or .vox) with an audio format.  This is useful for automatically
opening files that do not contain any information describing their format.
For example, if you work with Dialogic files, you can associate the .vox
extension with one of the Telephony formats.  Whenever you open a .vox
file, GoldWave will assume the format you specified and open the file
without prompting you for the format.

<br><br>

<p>To associate .vox with Dialogic ADPCM encoding:

<ol>
  <li> Enter the extension "vox" in the box.  Do not enter the leading
period.</li>
  <li> Select 8000 from the Rate drop down list.</li>
  <li> Select Telephony from the Format drop down list.</li>
  <li> Select "4-bit VOX ADPCM, mono" from the Attributes drop down

<p>To change an association:

<ol>
  <li> Remove the association, as above.</li>
  <li> Add the changed association, as above.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<p>The OS Associate button makes Windows associate GoldWave with the
given file type so that double-clicking on a file in Windows Explorer opens
the file in GoldWave.  OS Association also adds Open and Play commands
to the context menu for the file type when you right-click on a file.  You
might want to add an association for .wav files, since they are most
common.  Simply enter "wav" in the box and press the OS Association
button.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Digital Audio Attributes"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+2">Digital Audio Attributes</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>Digital audio is composed of thousands of pieces of data, called samples.
Each sample holds the loudness, or <em>amplitude</em>, of a sound at a given instant
in time.  This is similar to computer graphics where each point of light
(pixel) has a certain brightness and location.  All these points combine to
make a picture.  In digital audio, all the samples combine to make a sound. 
There are several attributes that determine the quality and quantity of digital
sound.  They are the <strong>sampling rate</strong>, the number of <strong>bits</strong>, and the number of
<strong>channels</strong>.

<br><br>
<p>The <strong>Sampling rate</strong> is the number of times, per second, that the amplitude
level is recorded.  It is measured in Hertz (seconds<sup>-1</sup>, Hz).  A high sampling
rate results in high quality digital sound in the same way that high graphics
resolution shows better picture quality.  Compact disks, for example, use a
sampling rate of 44100&nbsp;Hz, whereas telephone systems use a rate of only
8000&nbsp;Hz.

<br><br>
<p>The rate to use depends upon the type of sound and the amount of memory
and disk space you have available on you system.  Higher rates consume a
lot of space.  In the above example, the compact disk requires over 5 times
the amount of storage as the telephone system for the same digital sound. 
Certain types of sounds can be recorded at lower rates without loss of
quality.  Some standard rates are listed in Table A.1.

<br><br>
<p>The number of <strong>bits</strong> determines how accurately the amplitude of a sample is
recorded.  The two most common are 8&nbsp;bit and 16&nbsp;bit formats.  In an 8&nbsp;bit
sample, there are 256 different levels of amplitude.  16&nbsp;bit samples have
65,536 levels.  To compare the difference, let's say that you are a teacher
grading tests and you can use one of two marking schemes (Figure 24).  In
scheme #1, the mark is out of 10.  In scheme #2, the mark is out of 1000.
All marks must be rounded off (no decimals allowed).  If a student gets two
thirds of the questions right, then in scheme #1, the grade will be 7 out of
10.  In scheme #2, the grade will be 667 out of 1000.  Obviously, scheme
#2 is much more accurate.  In digital sound, low levels of accuracy can
cause noise due to quantization errors, as discussed later.

<br><br>
<p>The number of bits is becoming less important due to the variety of audio
compression techniques available today, such as RealAudio and MPEG.  By
using MPEG compression, for example, you can make a sound file
anywhere from 10 to 100 times smaller and still maintain excellent quality.
In compressed audio, the term "bits" has no meaning in the classical sense.

<br><br>

<br><br>
<p>Digital audio can have one or more <strong>channels</strong>.  Single channel audio,
referred to as a monaural (or mono) audio, contains information for only
one speaker and is similar to AM radio.  Two channel audio, or stereo
audio, contains data for two speakers, much like FM stereo.  Stereo sounds
can add depth, but they require twice as much storage and processing time
as mono sounds.  Movie theatres often have advanced audio systems with
4 or more channels, which are capable of making sounds appear to come
from certain directions.  Note that GoldWave supports mono and stereo
sound only.

<a name="Byte Swapping and Sign"></a>
<strong><font size="+2">Byte Swapping and Sign</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>In a computer, 8 bit samples fit perfectly into a single byte.  However, when
more bits are involved, such as 12, 16, or 32&nbsp;bit samples, more than one
byte is required.  Different processor designs (i.e. Motorola/Mac and Intel)
store these bytes in a different order.  Intel uses a "little endian" order, while
Motorola uses a "big endian" order.  For a sound created on one system to
play correctly on another, the bytes have to be reorder.  GoldWave
designates this as <strong>byte swapped</strong>.

<br><br>
<p>All samples may be interpreted as <strong>signed</strong> or <strong>unsigned</strong> values.  In general,
16&nbsp;bit samples are always signed, so they are interpreted as values ranging
from -32768 to -32767.  The same is not true for 8&nbsp;bit samples.  On a PC,
8&nbsp;bit samples are usually unsigned, so values range from 0 to 255.  On a
Mac, they are usually signed, so values range from -128 to 127.  This
inconsistency makes it necessary to explicitly state whether a sample is
signed or unsigned.

<a name="Frequency and Pitch"></a>
<strong><font size="+2">Frequency and Pitch</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>Sound windows in GoldWave show sound as a waveform of amplitudes on
a time axis.  However, sound can be viewed in an entirely different way by
examining its frequency/pitch content or <em>frequency spectrum</em>.  From this
perspective, all sounds are formed from a combination of simple
fundamental (sinusoidal) tones.  A rainbow is an example of a frequency
spectrum where visible light is broken down into bands of simple
fundamental colours, such as red, yellow, green, etc.  The actual colour of
the sun is formed by combining these colours.  A similar process applies to
audio.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Frequency Ranges"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Frequency Ranges</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>Average human hearing spans a frequency range from about 20&nbsp;Hz to about
17000&nbsp;Hz. Figure 25 shows some common sounds and the frequency range
they cover.

<p><center><img src="figure25.png" width="387" height="292" align="center" alt="Frequency Range of Sounds"><br>
Figure 25: Frequency Range of Sounds</center>

<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
Many people wonder why it is difficult to remove vocals from
music.  From Figure 25, we see there is a large overlap in the
frequency range of speech and music.  Removing the vocals would
also remove a significant part of the music.  A similar problem
occurs when removing hiss noise, since it often covers the entire
spectrum.

<br><br>
<p>Most basic stereo systems have bass and treble controls, which offer limited
control over a frequency spectrum.  Bass applies to low frequency sounds,
such as drums, cellos, low piano notes, or a hum noise.  Treble applies to
high frequency sounds, such as a clash of cymbals, a tweet of a small bird,
high notes on a piano, or a hiss noise.

<br><br>
<p>More expensive stereo systems have Graphic Equalizers, which provide
better control over a frequency spectrum.  Instead of controlling just two
bands (bass and treble), you can control many bands.

<br><br>
<p>GoldWave provides even more control over frequency spectrums with filter
effects such as Parametric EQ, Highpass, Lowpass, Bandpass, Bandstop,
and Equalizer.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Frequency Range and Sampling Rate"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Frequency Range and Sampling Rate</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>The frequency range of a digital sound is limited by its sampling rate.  In
other words, a sound sampled at 8000&nbsp;Hz cannot record frequencies above
8000&nbsp;Hz.  In fact, the sound cannot even have frequencies above 4000&nbsp;Hz. 
According to the sampling theorem, the maximum frequency is limited to
half the sampling rate.

<br><br>
<p>CD audio is designed to cover the full range of human hearing, which has
a maximum of just under 20&nbsp;kHz.  In order to successfully record this range,
the sampling theorem states that we must use a sampling rate at least twice
that maximum.  That is why CD audio uses a sampling rate in excess of
40&nbsp;kHz.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Frequency Spectrum Graphs"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Frequency Spectrum Graphs</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>Several of GoldWave's Device Controls graphs transform
sounds into a range of frequency bands using a radix-2 fast Fourier
transform (FFT) algorithm.  When the results are drawn using colours, the
graph is referred to as a spectrogram.  When the results are drawn with lines,
it is often referred to as a frequency spectrum or <em>frequency analysis</em>.

<br><br>
<p>Frequency analysis graphs are displayed in the Noise reduction and
Parametric EQ filter effects.  These help you to locate frequencies that you
would like to remove or enhance.

<br><br>
<p>GoldWave optionally applies a windowing function to the data before
performing the FFT (see <strong>Device Controls Graph Properties</strong> section).  This
reduces "discontinuity" errors that occur when dividing data into small
chunks.  The Hamming window is used by default.  The Kaiser window also
gives good results.

To make the spectrum more realistic to human hearing, magnitudes are
scaled logarithmically.  This means that if one frequency "sounds" twice as
loud as another, it will be graphed with twice the height (or the
corresponding colour for the spectrogram).

<br><br>
<p><hr>
<br><br>
<a name="Problems with Recording"></a>
<strong><font size="+2">Problems with Recording</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>There are five potential problems when recording sound:  aliasing, clipping,
quantization, internal noise, and system configuration.

<br><br>
<p><strong>Aliasing</strong> occurs when the sampling process does not get enough data to
correctly determine the shape of the sound wave.  The recorded sound will
have missing tones (Figure 26, top) or new tones that never existed in the
original sound (Figure 26, bottom).  These problem can be eliminated by
using higher sampling rates or by using anti-aliasing filters.

<p><center><img src="figure26.png" width="281" height="271" align="center" alt="Aliasing"><br>
Figure 26: Aliasing</center>

<p>Higher sampling rates increase the number of sampling points.  To see how
this works, try adding a few points between each sampling point in the
figure and redraw the graph.  The recorded sound will more closely
resemble the input.

<br><br>
<p>Anti-aliasing filters remove all tones that cannot be sampled correctly.  They
prevent high pitched tones from being aliased to low pitch.  Many sound
cards include anti-aliasing filters in hardware.

<br><br>
<p><strong>Clipping</strong> errors occur when the sampled amplitude is outside the range of
valid values.  If, for example, the range is -1.0 to 1.0, and a value of 1.2 is
sampled, then the value must be clipped to 1.0 (see Figure 27).  This
generates distortion. To eliminate clipping, adjust the recording volume before
recording.  By using the Device Controls' monitor feature, you can analyse
the level to determine a suitable volume.  The volume is low enough when
the red LEDs remain off.

<br><br>
<p><center><img src="figure27.png" width="193" height="176" align="center" alt="Clipping"><br>
Figure 27: Clipping</center>

<p><strong>Quantization</strong> errors occur when the sample is rounded to the nearest level
of amplitude.  This can be explained by using the "marking schemes"
example in the previous section.  The number two thirds (2/3) is represented
by 7/10 in scheme #1.  This gives a quantization error of:

<br><br>
<p>	| 7/10 - 2/3&nbsp;|&nbsp;= 1/30

<br><br>
<p>Similarly, in scheme #2, the quantization error is:

<br><br>
<p>	| 667/1000 - 2/3&nbsp;|&nbsp;= 1/3000

<br><br>
<p>Clearly, scheme #2 has the smallest error.  Therefore, using 16 bits instead
of 8 bits is a good way to reduce quantization errors.

<br><br>
<p>The other two recording problems deal with computer hardware and
software.  To minimize <strong>internal noise</strong>, make sure your audio card is
installed as far away from your graphics card as possible.  If you use a
microphone, keep it away from your monitor and computer fan.  Remember
to use shielded cables.

<br><br>
<p><strong>System configuration</strong> can also affect audio quality.  Recording to a
compressed drive (DriveSpace) is not recommend.  Compression ratios on
audio are generally poor and the CPU overhead can cause gaps during
recording.  Due to architectural problems with PCs and excessive virtual
memory swapping by Windows, you may notices an occasional gap when
recording.  If such a gap occurs at the beginning of recording, disable the
<strong>Allow undo</strong> option under Device Controls Recording Properties.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Overview"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+2">Overview</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>The Expression Evaluator is a versatile tool for manipulating and generating
audio data. After you select <strong>Expression evaluator</strong> from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu,
you are presented with a dialog that is similar in appearance to a calculator.

<br><br>
<p>The <strong>Destination</strong> is the Sound window where results of the evaluation will
be stored.  The drop down list contains all Sound windows in the form "<em>X</em> -
<em>NAME</em>", where <em>X</em> is the wave identifier number of the Sound window and
<em>NAME</em> is the filename of the sound.  For example, a Sound window with the
title "HELLO.SND" could appear as "1 - HELLO.SND" in the list.  By
default, the destination is set to the current Sound window.  You can change
the destination, if more than one Sound window is opened, by using the up
and down keys or by selecting it with the mouse from the drop down list.

<br><br>
<p>A <strong>Source</strong> is a Sound window containing existing audio data that will be
used in the expression.  By selecting a source from this list, the function
<strong>wave<em>X</em>(</strong> will be placed in the expression.  <em>X</em> is the wave identifer number,
as explained above.

<br><br>
<p>A large <strong>Expression</strong> box is located in the middle of the dialog.  This is
where an expression is entered.  A list of valid operations and functions is
given in a following section.  In most cases, expressions will be some
function of <em>n</em> or <em>t</em>, just as in regular math, where <em>y</em> is usually a function of <em>x</em>
(i.e. <em>y = f(x)</em>).  In the expression evaluator, we can have <em>destination = f(t)</em>,
where <em>f(t)</em> is any expression you enter.

<br><br>
<p>To create a simple tone, for example, you would enter the expression
<strong>sin(600*t)</strong>.  You can even alter an existing sound.  To double the volume
of "1 - HELLO.SND", for example, you would select it as the destination
and enter the expression <strong>wave1(n)*2</strong>.

<br><br>
<p>To enter an expression, you can:

<ol>
  <li> Type it in using the keyboard.</li>
  <li> Click on the "calculator" buttons with the mouse.</li>
</ol>

<p>or

<ol>
  <li> Use the <strong>Group name</strong> and <strong>Expression name</strong> boxes to select a
previously saved expression.</li>
</ol>

<p>The evaluator uses three special variables, which you can initialize in the
<strong>Variables</strong> box.  These variables are discussed later.

<br><br>
<p>After you have specified the destination, expression, and initial values,
choose the <strong>Start</strong> button (or just press the "Enter" key) to begin evaluation. 
If you entered an expression incorrectly, a message will be displayed by the
word <strong>Status</strong>.  The <strong>Status</strong> area also gives the progress during evaluation. 
Since the evaluation process takes time, you can stop it at any time with the
<strong>Cancel</strong> button.  Pressing the <strong>Cancel</strong> button a second time will close the
Expression Evaluator dialog.

<br><br>
<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
You can copy, cut and paste expression in the Expression box using
the usual keystrokes (Copy = Ctrl+C, Cut = Ctrl+X, Paste =
Ctrl+V).  You can also copy and paste expression from the online
help.

<br><br>
<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
To speed up evaluation, make sure that you are using RAM storage
(see <strong>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File</strong>).  A co-processor can dramatically increase the
speed of the evaluation, since the evaluator uses floating point
calculations.  By creating a new mono sound with a low sampling
rate (11025&nbsp;Hz),  you can experiment with expressions quicker.
You can then create a sound with a higher sampling rate for the
final evaluation.

<a name="Evaluation Range, Variables, and Constants"></a>
<strong><font size="+2">Evaluation Range, Variables, and Constants</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>Knowledge of the structure of digital audio is essential to understand how
the evaluator works.  To illustrate this structure, let's assume we have the
following sound:

<pre>
Title bar:          HELLO.SND
Total length:       2.0 seconds
Sampling rate:      8000 Hz
Start marker:       0.5 seconds
Finish marker:      1.2 seconds
</pre>

<p><center><img src="figure28.png" width="591" height="126" align="center" alt="File Structure"><br>
Figure 28: Internal Structure of HELLO.SND, 8000&nbsp;Hz, 2 Seconds</center>

<p>Digital audio is stored as a series of amplitudes, which are often referred to
as samples (see Figure 28).  The evaluator interprets each sample as a value
between -1 and 1, inclusive.  If the result of an evaluation is outside this
range, it will be clipped.  Only samples between the start and finish markers
are considered valid; all other values are assumed to be zero.  The number
of samples selected is defined as <em>N</em>.

<br><br>
<p>Each sample has a relative index number, <em>n</em>, and a time, <em>t</em>.  Since the time
of each sample depends on the sampling rate, it is usually written in terms
of the unit of time between each sample, <em>T</em>.  You many have noticed that the
time, <em>t</em>, is related to the index number, <em>n</em>, by the equation <em>t=nT</em>.  Figure 28
shows how all these variables relate to the structure of the sound.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Using Time in an Expression"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Using Time in an Expression</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>Let's assume we have entered the expression <strong>sin(t)</strong>.  Since expressions are
evaluated over the selection range, the initial value for <em>t</em> is automatically set
to start marker's position of 0.5.  By choosing the <strong>Start</strong> button, the
expression will be evaluated from <em>t</em> = 0.5 to <em>t</em> = 1.2 in steps of 1/8000 of a
second, as defined by <em>T</em>.  This means that the expression is calculated for
each sample in the selection, changing each sample as follows:

<br><br>
Sample<sub>4000</sub> = sin(0.500000)<br>
Sample<sub>4001</sub> = sin(0.500125)<br>
Sample<sub>4002</sub> = sin(0.500250)<br>
...<br>
Sample<sub>9600</sub> = sin(1.200000)<br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Using the Sample Index in an Expression"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Using the Sample Index in an Expression</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The sample index is useful for modifying an existing sound.  If we want to
double the amplitude of HELLO.SND, for example, we need to multiply
each sample by two and store it back into the sound.  In this case,
HELLO.SND will be both the destination and the source.  To set it as the
destination, we simply select it from the <strong>Destination</strong> list.  To use it as a
source, we need to determine its wave identifier number.  These numbers
are provided in the <strong>Source</strong> list.  Assuming it is listed as "3 - HELLO.SND",
we now know that its wave identifier number is 3.  This number is necessary
for the evaluator's <strong>wave</strong> function, which has the following syntax:

<br><br>
<p>		wave<em>X</em>(<em>n</em>)	where:	<em>X</em> = wave identifer number

<p>					<em>n</em> = sample index number

<br><br>
<p><img src="note.png" width="45" height="24" align="left" alt="Note">
In the evaluator, the index number, <em>n</em>, is <em>relative</em> to the start marker.
This means that the start markers position is added to the index
number (i.e. <em>n</em>+Start).  For the example in Figure 28, a relative
index of <em>n</em>=0 has an absolute index of 4000.  The <strong>Start</strong> sample
always has a relative index of 0.

<br><br>
<p>The final expression is <strong>wave3(n)*2</strong>.  By choosing <strong>Start</strong>, this expression will
be evaluated from <em>n</em>=0 to <em>n</em>=5600 in steps of 1 (note that <em>N&nbsp;=&nbsp;5600</em>) .  This
produces the following changes (remember than <em>n</em> is relative):

<br><br>
Sample<sub>4000</sub> = Sample<sub>4000</sub> * 2<br>
Sample<sub>4001</sub> = Sample<sub>4001</sub> * 2<br>
Sample<sub>4002</sub> = Sample<sub>4001</sub> * 2<br>
...<br>
Sample<sub>9600</sub> = Sample<sub>9600</sub> * 2<br>

<br><br>
<p>Note that <em>N</em> and <em>n</em> are always integers.  The evaluator rounds indices to the
nearest integer, so the expression  <strong>wave3(.7)</strong> would be calculated as
<strong>wave3(1)</strong>.

<br><br>
<p>You can use the sample index number and the <strong>wave</strong> function to mix two or
more wave together.  If you have several sounds opened, you can obtain the
wave identifier number for each sound from the <strong>Source</strong> list.  If the sounds
you wanted to mix were identified as 2 and 3, you would enter the
expression:

<br><br>
<p>		wave2(n) + wave3(n)

<br><br>
<p>Care must be taken when indexing signals with different sampling rates. 
Assume <strong>wave1</strong> is a voice recorded at 11025&nbsp;Hz and <strong>wave2</strong> is music
recorded at 22050&nbsp;Hz.  If you want to mix these two signals, with <strong>wave1</strong> as
the destination, then the expression

<br><br>
<p>		wave1(n) + wave2(n*2)

<br><br>
<p>must be used (ideally, <strong>wave2</strong> would have to be low-pass filtered first).
Whereas, if <strong>wave2</strong> is the destination, the expression should be

<br><br>
<p>		wave1(n/2) + wave2(n)

<br><br>
<p>A variable N has several uses, such as reversing a sample.  Assume <strong>wave2</strong>
is a new sound that has the same sampling rate and length of <strong>wave1</strong>.  By
setting the destination to <strong>wave2</strong> and using the expression

<br><br>
<p>		wave1(N-n)

<br><br>
<p><strong>wave2</strong> will be the reverse of <strong>wave1</strong>.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="User Variable f"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>User Variable f</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The user variable, <em>f</em>, can be set to any value you choose.  In many cases, this
value is used as a frequency, hence the letter "f".  For example, if you
entered the expression

<br><br>
<p>		sin(2*pi*f*t)

<br><br>
<p>you can then generate any sine wave by specifying the frequency in the <strong>f</strong>
box.  This value does not change during evaluation, but stays at the value
you assign to it.  Technically, one might classify <em>f</em> as a constant.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name="Conversion Between Variables"></a>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Conversion Between Variables</strong></font>

<br><br>
<p>The following equations convert between time and sample index number.
The <em>start</em> parameter is the position of the start marker (in seconds).

<p><em>n = (t - start) / T</em>
<p><em>t = nT + start</em>

<a name="Custom Filters"></a>
<strong><font size="+2">Custom Filters</font></strong>

<br><br>
<p>One of the easiest ways to create your own digital filters is to use Matlab<sup></sup>
(<u>The Student Edition of Matlab</u>, by The Math Works Inc., published by
Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-855974-0).  It has many built-in commands that
generate filter coefficients.  The coefficients can then used in the Expression
Evaluator or the User defined filter command.

<br><br>
<p><strong>Example of a Low-Pass Filter</strong>

<br><br>
<p>In preparation for down-sampling, you can use Matlab to generate the
coefficients of a 4th order Butterworth low pass filter that will remove noise
above half the Nyquist frequency (&#188; the sampling rate).  Enter:

<br><br>
<p>	[b,a] = butter(4, 0.5)

<br><br>
<p>The result should be similar to:

<pre>
b =  0.0940  0.3759  0.5639  0.3759  0.0940
a =  1.0000  0.0000  0.4680  0.0000  0.0177
</pre>

<p>To implement this filter in the evaluator, let's assume that the sound to be
filtered is in the Sound window titled SOUND.SND.

<ol>
  <li> Use <strong>File&nbsp;|&nbsp;New</strong> to create a new Sound window with the same
sampling rate as SOUND.SND.</li>
  <li> Make sure the length of the new sound is as long (or longer) than
the original.  If it is not, use <strong>Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Insert space</strong> to increase its
length.</li>
  <li> Use <strong>Tools&nbsp;|&nbsp;Expression evaluator</strong> to open the expression evaluator
dialog.</li>
  <li> Set the destination to the new sound.</li>
  <li> Enter the following expression (assuming SOUND.SND has a wave
identifier of 1):
<pre>
	wave1(n)*0.0940 + wave1(n-1)*0.3759 +
	wave1(n-2)*0.5639 + wave1(n-3)*0.3759 +
	wave1(n-4)*0.0940 - wave2(n-2)*0.4860 -
	wave2(n-4)*0.0177
</pre></li>
  <li> Choose <strong>Start</strong>.</li>

<a name="Common Questions and Answers"></a>
<strong><font size="+2">Common Questions and Answers</font></strong>

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>Why do I get only silence when I try to record?</strong>

<p>	You have to select the correct recording source.  See
<strong>Recording Sounds</strong> under <strong>Device Controls Overview</strong>.

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>How do I record from the CD player?</strong>

<p>	If you have a SCSI or MMC compliant CD-ROM drive, you may be able to use the CD
Audio Extraction tool.  See <strong>Tools&nbsp;|&nbsp;CD audio extraction</strong>.
If you want to record using your sound card, you need to select the
CD-ROM as the recording source for your sound card.  See <strong>Recording
Sounds</strong>, under <strong>Device Controls Overview</strong>, for
more information.

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>How can I adjust recording volume levels without recording?</strong>

<p>	Go to the <strong>Device Controls Record Properties</strong> and select the
<strong>Monitor</strong> option.  A file must be open.

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>How can I improve recording quality?</strong>

<p>	Disable the <strong>Allow undo</strong> option under the
<strong>Device Controls Record Properties</strong>.  Do not use
disk compression (DriveSpace).  Resize the
Device Controls window to hide the real-time graphs.  Change the
Record buffer value in the <strong>Device Properties</strong>.  See <strong>Appendix
A</strong>: <strong>Problems with Recording</strong> section for additional information.

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>How do I select part of a sound?</strong>

<p>	Use the left mouse button to set the beginning of the selection and
the right mouse button to sent the end.  See <strong>Editing Overview</strong> for
more information.

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>How can I tell if the finish marker is in the right place without playing
the entire selection?</strong>

<p>	Go to the <strong>Device Controls Playback Properties</strong> and select the the
<strong>Finish</strong> option for the User play button.  Clicking the User play
button will play part of the selection just a few seconds before the
finish marker.

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>Can I edit individual samples with the mouse?</strong>

<p>	Yes, see <strong>Editing the Waveform with the Mouse</strong>, under <strong>Editing
Overview</strong>.

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>Can I play MOD files with GoldWave?</strong>

<p>	No, but you can extract the instrument samples.  After you select
the file with <strong>File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Open</strong>, the <strong>Raw File Format</strong> dialog is displayed.
Set the attributes to 8-bit, mono, signed, 16000&nbsp;Hz, no swap.  By
using the start/finish markers, you can extract the individual
instruments.  <em>Warning: do not save the MOD file within GoldWave.
GoldWave does not update the MOD header.</em>

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>Why does GoldWave show the shareware messages?</strong>

<p>	Normally, GoldWave will automatically detect a registered user.
However, if you see the shareware message, you will need to enter
your registration password again.

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>Can I convert sound files to MIDI?</strong>

<p>	No.  MIDI files do not contain digital audio.  They contain notes
and timing information for instruments.  In other words, they
contain instructions for playing the music, but not the music itself.

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>How are you?</strong>

<p>	Fine, thanks.

<br><br><br>
<p><strong>Why don't VOC files saved by GoldWave work with my Sound Blaster
software?</strong>

<p>	GoldWave uses version 1.20 of the VOC file format.  You can save
your files in the old format (version 1.0) by using the <strong>File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Save as</strong>
command.  GoldWave will use the old format if the file is an 8-bit,
mono file with a sampling rate less than 23000&nbsp;Hz.  You may have
to use the <strong>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Resample</strong> command to reduce the sampling
rate.  You can convert the file by selecting "VOC (*.voc)" and
"8-bit, mono, unsigned" from the type and attributes lists.
