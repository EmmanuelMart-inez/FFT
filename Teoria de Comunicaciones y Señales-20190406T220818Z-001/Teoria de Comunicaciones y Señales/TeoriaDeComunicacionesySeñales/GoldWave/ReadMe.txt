2.0 Installation, Uninstall
--------------------------------------------------------------

2.1) Installation

If you downloaded the self-installing version, simply run
the program.

If you downloaded the zip version, create a new
"GoldWave" folder, such as:
  C:\Program Files\GoldWave
and unzip or copy all files into that folder.  Create a short
cut to the "goldwave.exe" program file in the folder.

2.2) Uninstall

If you installed the self-installing version, you can use
the Windows "Add/Remove Programs" feature under Control Panel.

To manually uninstall, delete the following files from your
Windows folder:
    express.eqx
    gwpreset.ini
    goldwave.ini
Delete the GoldWave folder.  Other files are listed in
section 4.0.

3.0 Important Additional Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------

3.1) Windows 95 or later is required to run this version.

3.2) Video display must be configured for 16-bit colour for
best results.  If you experience any lock-ups during recording
or playback, update your video driver and your sound card
driver.

3.3) For MPEG Layer 3 support (mp3) you must have the Windows
Media modules installed.  Installing the new version of
Media Player will add these modules to your system.  To save
MP3 files, either BladeEnc.dll or Lame_Enc.dll needs to be
installed in the GoldWave folder.
